Cash Out responded to the allegations via Instagram stories, and his side of the tale is a little murky. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>So, what happened to Cash Out, and what might happen to him in the future?</p><h2>What Happened to Cash Out?</h2><p>On April 13, 2022,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="follow noopener">WSB-TV2</a> reported on the allegations Cash Out was facing. The prosecutors indicted him on charges of sex trafficking and rape.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Furthermore, he is also caused of&nbsp;luring women into prostitution using his celebrity status. According to the prosecutors, Cash Out developed a criminal enterprise and status with a convincing story to attract women. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>District Attorney Fani Wills commented on the allegations and said that women were victimized by people "who had a chance to do something else with their lives."</p><p>Another District Attorney, Earnell Winfrey, told Channel 2 investigative reporter Mark Winne that only two had been rescued out of all the sex workers.</p><p>She added some women were vulnerable, and Cash Out made them believe he would take care of them. But unfortunately, he did the opposite and "began to pimp them out." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Cash Out is the head of the criminal organization, and 41 count indictment was handed down against him and five other people involved.</p><p>As reported by <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">CBS 46</a>, the rapper's mother, Linda Smith, best known as Morenika Vinie and 'Mama Cash Out,' is also involved in the racket.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Similarly, Cash Out's Pyrez Music Group LLC brand is also allegedly involved in these crimes.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Personally, the rapper faces 13 counts that include rape, racketeering, trafficking a person for sexual servitude, and aggravated sodomy.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Moreover, he has also received allegations of keeping prostitution at home and beating a sex worker, who he had recruited,&nbsp;with a belt.</p><p>Looking upon all the crimes, Cash Out might face a sentence of 25 years to life imprisonment in jail, as per Winfrey. But, she said,&nbsp;he&nbsp;had pled not guilty to the accusations before.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>The defense document claimed&nbsp;he was falsely accused of rape since he did not have "sexual intercourse with the alleged accuser." Similarly, it claimed that the accuser of the sexual servitude charge had never been in servitude.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>According to Winfrey, the rapper is currently in jail but has not officially been convicted.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p><strong>Cash Out defended himself on Instagram stories against rape, trafficking, and racketeering allegations. </strong>(Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Cash Out Defended Himself on Instagram</h2><p>As soon as the news of the indictments got out, Cash Out took to Instagram to defend himself. On April 14, 2022, he shared a Bible verse on Instagram stories, asking for his freedom.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>He said, "The Lord says I am the one who strengthens you.&nbsp;Why should you fear mortals who are no more enduring than grass."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p>He wrote about why people should live in fear of the wrath of people who are ready to oppress and destroy others.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>He then wrote that the fury of those people could not touch others. At last, he noted prisoners would be set free and be more prosperous than before and ended his story with the hashtag #FREECASHOUT.</p><p>Other than this, Cash Out has not commented on the allegations.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJuRqLVuu9StZJqknJq0osDIqKWsZZqWtq16x62kpQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./facebook-review-pizza-restaurant-rant.html><span>←</span><span>Pizza worker's shocking foul-mouthed rant at gran who gave restaurant a one-star Facebook review</span></a>
