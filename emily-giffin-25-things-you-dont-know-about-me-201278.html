<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>Emily Giffin: 25 Things You Don't Know About Me</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Author <strong>Emily Giffin</strong>, 40, shared 25 things you don’t know about her with <a href=#>Us Weekly</a>. Her new book, Where We Belong, is available now.</p><p>1. I do not like speed. I have not driven on a highway since 1996 and have never been on a roller coaster.</p><p>2. I can name any Brady Bunch episode in 10 seconds or fewer and cannot be stumped in even the most obscure trivia question related to that show.</p><p>3. I am obsessed with typefaces and fonts. My favorite is Nicholas Cochin.</p><p>4. If I could do anything besides write, and get paid for it, I would be a professional baby naming consultant or a therapist.</p><p>5. I was the men’s basketball manager at Wake Forest University during the <strong>Tim Duncan</strong> era. Once, when we were playing Carolina on the road in a televised game, I left the jerseys behind. A police escort barely got them to the game on time.</p><p>6. I am good at keeping secrets. My own and others.</p><p>7. I think I might have mixed up my identical twin sons shortly after they were brought home from the hospital. We will never know the truth.</p><p>8. I love winter, and January is my favorite month of the year.</p><p>9. I can say the alphabet as quickly backwards as I can forwards.</p><p>10. My parents are on far ends of the political spectrum — which is why I think I’m so moderate and lukewarm about politics.</p><p>11. I have a mild, diagnosed case of prosopagnosia a.k.a. “face blindness.” At least once a week, I’m embarrassed by not recognizing someone I should know.</p><p>12. I got into Harvard Law School, but went to Virginia. After graduation, I practiced law at a Manhattan firm for five years.</p><p><img decoding=async src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="Emily Giffin book" width=467 height=600 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>13. When I was in high school, my boyfriend and I got jobs together at a restaurant. Our first paychecks came and he got 50 cents more per hour than I. It became my first “legal” claim, and I demanded that the manager pay me back wages at the end of the summer.</p><p>14. I take an insane number of photographs. It is a rare day when my camera does not see action.</p><p>15. I am very noise sensitive and can’t stand the sound of radio or television commercials. My children have adopted my mantra: “commercials are pollution in the home.”</p><p>16. I have been&nbsp; No. 2 on the New York Times bestseller list five times, but have never been number one. My husband calls me the Buffalo Bills of writers.</p><p>17. The only time I ever spanked one of my three children was right inside the gates of Epcot.</p><p>18. I believed in Santa Claus until the seventh grade.</p><p>19. About once a month, I dream that <strong>Jennifer</strong> <strong>Aniston</strong> and I are BFFs.</p><p>20. I met my husband at LaGuardia Airport.&nbsp;</p><p>21. My favorite colors are orange and pink. My whole office is decorated in that color scheme.</p><p>22. My first celebrity crush was <strong>River Phoenix</strong>; my current crush is <strong>Adrian Grenier</strong>.</p><p>23. My first kiss was with a French exchange student named Sebastian. It was a true French kiss. Ha.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>24. I was supposed to meet a friend at the fountain between the World Trade Center towers on 9/11 at 9 a.m. I moved to London five days later in the first international flight that left the country.</p><p>25. I have no sense of direction. As in none. For several months after moving into our new house, I turned left at the top of the stairs to get to my daughter’s room instead of right.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJymoZyueqi1xZ%2Bgp2Vianq1tMinnqxlqaTCbrDOp6tmo56kxG6twaisrWWdmnpzfJBrbnFn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./chuck-zito.html><span>←</span><span>Chuck Zito- Wiki, Age, Wife, Net Worth, Ethnicity, Height</span></a>
