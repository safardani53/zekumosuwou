The star of Netflix’s smash hit continues to open up about his lack of desire to have intimate moments onscreen.&nbsp;“It’s important to me in my real life to not have them,” he told <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Variety</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Penn-Badgley-You-netflix-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>He added, “My fidelity in my relationship. It’s important to me. And actually, it was one of the reasons that I initially wanted to turn the role down. I didn’t tell anybody that. But that is why.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>The person who “encouraged” Penn to play Joe Goldberg, the charming but extremely problematic serial killer in You, was his wife, <strong>Domino Kirke-Badgley.</strong>&nbsp;“And I wasn’t going to listen to anyone more than her,” he said.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Penn listened to his wife and took on the role of Joe. After its first season aired on Lifetime, Netflix picked up the show. You has become a massive hit for the streaming service, and the whole world has fallen in love with Penn’s portrayal of Joe.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Compared to previous seasons of You, there are significantly fewer sex scenes in <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>season 4</a> and all of them include Penn and his onscreen love interest <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Charlotte Ritchie</strong></a> fully clothed. Penn initially revealed on his<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> Podcrushed podcast</a> that he went to You executive producer <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Sera Gamble</strong></a> to discuss <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>doing fewer sex scenes</a> ahead of season 4.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Penn-Badgley-You-netflix-embed-2-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>“I said to Sera, ‘My desire would be zero, to go from 100 to zero.’ But I signed this contract. I signed up for this show. I know what I did. You can’t take this aspect out of the DNA of the concept. So how much less can you make it, was my question to them,” he said.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>The <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Gossip Girl alum</a> noted that Sera was “really glad” that he was “honest” with her about his feelings. “She was sort of… I want to say almost like empowered. Yeah, she had a really positive response. And they came back with a phenomenal reduction,” he admitted. The first 5 episodes of You season 4 are available to stream now. The second batch of episodes will be released on March 9.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH1ze5BtZqmdnqN6o63DoKOesV2osrl50pycp52jYsG2vs1mm6ivnmLGsMGMq6alnV8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mum-blogger-constance-hall-defends-clemmie-hooper-fake-profile-trolling.html><span>←</span><span>Lazy mum blogger who lets kids eat with hands used fake profile to hit back at trolls who said</span></a>
