“He was literally in a very public marriage and a very public divorce, and I had to go through all that s—t very publicly and it was very hard for us,” Vanessa later recalled during a 2022 episode of The Ultimatum."><meta name=author content="Larita Shotwell"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

We literally fell deeper and harder than we ever could.”</p><p>The couple, who <a href=#>tied the knot in 2011</a> — five years after forming a romantic connection on the set of Nick’s 2006 music video, “What’s Left of Me” — went on to welcome <a href=#>three children</a>: sons Camden and Phoenix and daughter Brooklyn. However, Vanessa experienced complications with Phoenix’s premature birth and had to undergo <a href=#>scary emergency surgery</a>.</p><p>“I was in the hospital on bed rest and then my water broke. I was only 29 weeks,” Vanessa revealed on <a href=#>Dancing With the Stars</a> in 2017, several months after her youngest child’s birth. “I was on the operating bed and I looked up and I didn’t know a single face and I remembered thinking I hope the baby’s OK and don’t worry about me. Just make him OK.”</p><p>Fortunately, both Vanessa and Phoenix made it through the terrifying ordeal, and the family of five have since gone on to live a happy — and jealousy-inducing — life in Hawaii. The Lacheys, who frequently gush about their children, moved to the tropical locale after the Philippines native landed her historic role on NCIS: Hawai’i in 2001.</p><p>“I’ve never felt more at home than I do in Hawaii,” Vanessa exclusively told <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> in March 2022. “Honestly, I constantly tell [Nick] how lucky I feel that we get to be here as a family.”</p><p>That same month, however, <a href=#>Nick found himself in legal trouble</a> when involved in an altercation with a celebrity photographer who was snapping photos of him and Vanessa in Beverly Hills. In the wake of the incident, the “Hardest Thing” crooner “must participate in <a href=#>anger management classes and attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings</a>,” a spokesperson for the Los Angeles District Attorney’s office exclusively told Us in March 2023, explaining that the “successful completion of the Prefiling Diversion Program will result in no criminal charges being filed.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>As for <a href=#>Vanessa’s stance on the drama</a>, she “stands by Nick, but she agrees that he didn’t handle the situation correctly,” a source exclusively told Us. “He behaved inappropriately. She says this whole ordeal has been a wake-up call and that we can all learn from it, especially Nick.”</p><p>Keep scrolling to see Vanessa’s ups and downs through the years:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkw6K6xKyqmmWclrCpsdisZK6oo2Kur7CMnaawpqNivLex0WaroZ1drrKivtJo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-jacket-that-should-be-in-your-closet-right-now.html><span>←</span><span>Jessica Alba, Kate Moss, Kat Dennings Style: Leather Moto Jacket</span></a>
