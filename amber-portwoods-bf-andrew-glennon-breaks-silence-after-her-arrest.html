All I know is what I need to do, like, right now, and that is to provide James with a safe, secure happy environment.”</p><p>Glennon noted that “babies imprint at a young age,” so it is important to “put happy memories into” James.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Amber-Portwood-Andrew-Glennon.jpg><p>Portwood, 29, was <a href=#>arrested for felony domestic battery</a> on July 5 after allegedly hitting Glennon while he was holding James. The Teen Mom OG star, who was <a href=#>released from jail</a> the next day, <a href=#>wielded a machete</a> and “threatened to kill herself” during the altercation, according to court documents.</p><p>“If you could imagine having your whole world and everything that you love flipped upside down in a heartbeat, that’s it,” Glennon told DailyMailTV while discussing the incident. “There’s gonna be a lot of healing that needs to be done and repairing between James and I. As far as relationships go in the future … a lot of healing has to be done for everybody.”</p><p>In the wake of her arrest, Portwood was <a href=#>ordered to stay away from Glennon</a> after he claimed in court documents that she was <a href=#>“unable to provide a safe, stable and secure environment” for their son</a>. The no-contact order was later lifted, and the MTV personality was <a href=#>granted supervised visits with James</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>A source previously told Us Weekly exclusively that “there were <a href=#>things going on between” the couple</a> that led to their July 5 altercation. However, after Portwood posted a <a href=#>cryptic message about cheating</a> on Instagram, Glennon insisted that he has <a href=#>always been faithful</a> to her.</p><p>“My name was never mentioned in the post that she released … I guess it was just rough timing,” he told DailyMailTV. “People are just going to slap it on me. It’s a bashing of my character, and what hurts, I guess, is the fact that she hasn’t come out and made a statement to say, you know, ‘I wasn’t talking about Andrew. I was talking about somebody else.’”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaapZKav268zqursKefmcBursVmmKecoprEbrPLnqWnp55ir7OxwKSqZquZobKvr8RmmJ%2Bslad6qbHRZpirqpWowXA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tyrese-gibson-splits-wife-samantha-lee.html><span>←</span><span>Tyrese Gibson splits from second wife Samantha Lee after three years of marriage and blames 'broken</span></a>
