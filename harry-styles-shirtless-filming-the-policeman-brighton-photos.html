The former boy band member, who plays a closeted gay man married to a woman in the 1950s, covered up his extensive chest and arm tattoos with makeup. He was seen swimming in the chilly water for 15 minutes, and was helped in and out of the sea by crew members, as they filmed scenes on the English coast.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Harry-Styles-Shirtless-Plunge-Water-Filming-embed-1.jpg alt=harry width=620 height=1095 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p id=content-paragraph-4>The <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>“Watermelon Sugar” hitmaker</a> had body makeup running down his chest as he walked out of the sea alongside crew, who wrapped him in towels to warm up.&nbsp;<strong>Linus Roache</strong>, who is set to portray an older version of Harry’s character in the film, was also seen on set. The flick, based on <strong>Bethan Roberts</strong>‘ novel, is set in Brighton in the 50s and follows Harry’s character Tom, who is married to Marion, played by The Crown‘s <strong>Emma Corrin</strong>. The closeted gay policeman has a decades-long affair with museum curator Patrick Hazlewood, played by <strong>David Dawson</strong>, in the Michael Grandage-helmed <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>period piece</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Fans of the chart topper turned actor would recall he made his cinematic debut in the 2017 war film Dunkirk, and is also set to make a splash in the psychological film Don’t Worry Darling opposite Little Women star <strong>Florence Pugh</strong>.

CAN YOU PLEASE ARREST ME. IT WOULD A PLEASURE!” The photos in question showed him running across the road while filming on May 14. He even donned the custodian helmet — a round, bucket-like helmet that’s synonymous with cops in the United Kingdom — which hung over his eyes as he jogged in uniform.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH12e5FpZqGZoqfGbr%2FTsqOeq12otaq%2B06WcrKtdm7atucinnmasmJp6sbvLopqepZGjeqO%2ByKCfraeeYr2pu9Ooqmg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./chrys-howard-19530313-html.html><span>←</span><span>Chrys Howard (Self-Help Author) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</span></a>
