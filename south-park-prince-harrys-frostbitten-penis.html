The adult animated comedy aired a fictional episode that appeared to directly mock Meghan Markle and husband Prince Harry as the characters endured a bit to gain total privacy having been working members of the Canadian Royal Family.
The programme aimed a particular hard-hitting dig at the Prince's 'blue penis' which appeared to be a clear reference to the Royal's frostbitten penis that he wrote about in excruciating detail in his memoir, Spare."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
