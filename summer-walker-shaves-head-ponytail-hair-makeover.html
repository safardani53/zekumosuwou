She posed with her profile in full view to show off the hair left in the middle of her head, fashioned into a ponytail with a few dreadlocks too. Her selfies also showed off her super cool tattoos, including a gorgeous rose piece on her neck. She accompanied the series of pictures by showing that this was a look she’d considered for a long time. “Legit wanted this hair style my whole life,” she wrote, with a series of emojis, per&nbsp;Pop Crave.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Summer’s new “Larry” tattoo was also on full-display in the series. She got the ink next to her left eye back in November 2021. The couple got the matching face tattoos, with&nbsp;<strong>Larry Lambert,&nbsp;</strong>who performs under the name&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Lvrd Pharoh</a>,&nbsp;</strong>getting ink that says “Summer” over his eye. Even though some <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>fans were confused</a> by the pair’s tattoos, a bunch were happy that Summer seemed so in love with her man. “He just increases my overall quality of life. I’ve never had someone put me and my child first before everything. To not have to lift a finger, for someone to truly be emotionally and spiritually intelligent and invested in me. It’s new and it’s nice,” she’d written about him back in October.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Summer-Walker-Shaves-Most-Of-Head-SS-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-8>Besides her fresh new cut, Summer has been pretty busy.
