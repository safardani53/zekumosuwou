Gordon after their car burst into flames on the M61 in <a href=#>Bolton</a>, Greater Manchester, on January 5.</p><p>Despite several <a href=#>confirmed sightings</a> and a <a href=#>heartfelt plea from her dad</a>, the trio remain missing.</p><p>Gordon, 48, is a <a href=#>registered sex offender</a>&nbsp;who served 20 years in US jail for rape and battery, while <a href=#>Constance</a>, 35, is from a family of wealthy landowners with <a href=#>links to British royalty</a>.</p><p>It is unclear how they met, but it appears the couple's childhood's were dramatically different.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE UK NEWS">READ MORE UK NEWS</h2><p>Born in <a href=#>Birmingham</a>, Gordon grew up in <a href=#>Florida</a> where he was convicted of attacking a woman at just 14 before being deported to the UK with his mum and half-siblings in 2010.</p><p>Meanwhile Constance spent her early years on the £100m, 5,000-acre Crichel Estate near Wimborne, <a href=#>Dorset</a>.</p><p>The land is home to Crichel House - a 17th century listed property sold for an estimated £34m in 2013 when Constance's dad, Napier Marten, gave up his fortune for a life in <a href=#>Australia</a>.</p><p>Her father was a page to the late <a href=#>Queen</a>, and her grandmother, Mary Anna Marten OBE, a playmate to <a href=#>Princess Margaret</a> whose godmother was the late <a href=#>Queen Mother</a>.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The Sun</h2></p><p>Constance, born in 1987, and her brothers, Maximilian, 34, and Tobias, 31, spent their younger years at the sprawling mansion.</p><p>The "immensely large" property, backdrop to <a href=#>Gwyneth Paltrow</a>'s 1996 Emma film adaptation, is home to 25 rooms, a ballroom and a wine cellar.</p><p>Overlooking a crescent-shaped lake, it was used as a school from 1940 until the Marten family moved in in 1960.</p><p>Constance enjoyed "naked picnics, siestas amid hay bales and tractor scoops" on the grounds, according to her Facebook page.</p><p>After leaving home and boarding school behind, she made a name for herself as an "it" girl, featuring in the fashion pages of Tatler magazine while a student in 2008.</p><p>She said in an accompanying interview that she loved drinking cider and considered it "one of [her] five-a-day".</p><p>Constance, known to friends as "Toots", is understood to have studied Arabic and Middle Eastern Studies at the University of Leeds before completing an NCTJ journalism qualification.</p><p>She later enrolled at East 15 drama school, allegedly paid for with a multimillion pound trust fund.</p><p>A former classmate told The Sunday Times she "could have gone very far" as she was <a href=#>"very, very talented"</a>, but dropped out in 2016.</p><h2>'MYSTERIOUS' COUPLE</h2><p>Later that year she moved in with Gordon in Ilford, East <a href=#>London</a>, it is reported.</p><p>Constance became estranged from her family because of her relationship with Gordon but still has access to their cash, The Times reports.</p><p>The couple appear to have lived reclusively, with neighbours describing them as "mysterious" people who rarely used their garden.</p><p>After complaints from residents, Constance and Gordon were allegedly evicted and moved to the Coldharbour Estate in the south east of the capital.</p><p>But they were evicted for a second time after not paying rent and causing thousands of pounds worth of damage to the property.</p><p>It is unclear where the pair lived between August and January 2023, but it is thought they drifted between rented homes and Airbnbs.</p><p>Constance and Gordon abandoned their burning car, which they had only bought six days earlier, on the M61 on January 5.</p><p>They left the motorway on foot carrying a baby and travelled southwards, paying for taxis in cash and using fake names in hotels.</p><p>They have since been spotted at Harwich Port and Colchester in Essex and East Ham, East London.</p><h2>DESPERATE SEARCH</h2><p>A frantic search is underway to try to locate the trio after police revealed Constance has not been seen by medical experts since giving birth just days before.</p><p>Last week, the investigation was taken over by the Met.</p><p>Detective Chief Inspector Rob Huddleston said: "We know some elements of the public may see police involvement as unwelcome and I would seek to assure you that we do not wish to impose ourselves for any reason other than to make sure the newborn baby is alive and well."</p><p>Cops believe they have a substantial amount of cash, allowing them to live off-grid.</p><p>Constance is not believed to have had any contact with her family since she disappeared.</p><p>This morning, her dad begged his daughter to get to safety.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>The film producer told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Independent</a>: "I want you to understand that you are much much loved whatever the circumstances.</p><p>"We are deeply concerned for your and your baby’s welfare."</p><img
