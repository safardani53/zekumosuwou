If your pup has any allergies, then make sure the product you’re considering doesn’t contain anything that could set these off – some dogs have allergies to grain, for instance.</p><p>The best dog dental chews for your fluffy friend will contain natural ingredients, and perhaps have added minerals to strengthen teeth, such as calcium, and improve breath freshness - this one’s for you, really.</p><p>Avoid products containing lots of fillers that are high in calories, as you don’t want to improve their dental health at the expense of their overall physical health. While the general rule is one dental stick per day, you should include this within your dog’s daily treat limit, and this total should be no more than 10% of their energy requirements for each day.</p><p>Dogs do like the taste of dental chews, so it’s like a treat and a plaque remover in one. Imagine if people could simply eat a chew to keep their teeth and gums healthy rather than going to the dentist. Wouldn’t that be gnashing?</p><h2>Best dog dental chews at a glance:</h2><h2><strong>Yu Move Dental Care Sticks</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Screenshot-2023-08-21-165739.png><ul><li><strong>Yu Move Dental Care Sticks For Medium Dogs, £18.99 for a pack of 14 from Amazon – <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>These dental chews have a hard outer shell and a soft centre which, creates a barrier along the teeth and gums and reduces plaque and tartar, says YuMove,</p><p>The soft centre is released when your dog chews, and this works against bad bacteria in the mouth, while at the same time supporting the good bacteria.

Maybe you have a small Chihuahua or a huge Dalmation; you're going to need to shop around to find the best choice for your furry friend.</p><p>We've rounded up a list of a few online retailers to help you get started.</p><h2>How much do dog dental chews cost?</h2><p>Despite everyone's pooch having different dietary requirements, our research into the best dog dental chews has shown that the prices don't vary too much, and it won't cost you a fortune to keep your dog happy.</p><p>On the cheaper side, you do get less in a pack, but that can be a great option for anyone looking to test out a particular product before investing in something their dog might not enjoy. These usually cost around the £5 mark, whereas if you know your dog's tastes and you're ready to just grab a reasonably sized pack, it will only set you back around £13.</p><h2><strong>How often should I give my dog a dental stick</strong>?</h2><p>You should check the individual brand for how often you should feed dental chews to your dog, but generally speaking, it’s okay to feed one dental chew or stick each day.</p><p>Some brands are available in different sizes to suit different dog breeds, but if your favourite dental sticks come in just one size and your dog is little, then it’s a good idea to feed half a stick or less. Again, check the back of the packet or the brand’s website, as it should be explained there.</p><h2><strong>Are dental chews enough for dogs?</strong></h2><p>Dental chews are a great way to help keep your dog’s teeth tartar and plaque-free, but the best solution for doggie breath and good dental hygiene is regular brushing – yes, just like for humans.</p><p>It’s best to do this from when they’re puppies, but it’s never too late to start brushing your dog’s teeth.</p><p>You can buy a brush that looks like a regular toothbrush or a thimble brush that fits over your finger – and use a toothpaste or gel specifically formulated for dogs. Do not use human toothpaste as some of the ingredients may not be suitable – for example, xylitol, which is often found in human toothpaste, is toxic for dogs.</p><p><a aria-label="The Dogs Trust (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener">The Dogs Trust</a> recommends a slow introduction to toothbrushing. Start by getting your dog used to you touching their mouth outside, then inside, before gradually introducing the toothbrush. The idea is not to frighten your pup but to get them to calmly and happily accept daily brushing as part of his routine.</p><p>Check your dog’s mouth regularly for signs of decay or gum disease, and have their teeth checked by your vet during regular appointments once or twice each year.</p><h2>How do I pick the best dog dental chews?</h2><p>We spoke to Nicki Fox, Veterinary Specialist at <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Admiral Pet Insurance</a>, RVN VNCertECC APVN (Wildlife), for her advice on how to choose the best dental chews for your dog.</p><p>She said: “When choosing the best chew, it is important to remember that the calorific intake from treats should not exceed 10% of a dog’s total daily caloric requirement."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>“If treats are given, the amount of food should be reduced accordingly. Check that the chew states that it removes plaque and tartar. The treat size should be appropriate for the size of the dog as tiny chews given to a large dog could be a choking hazard."</p><p>“Personally, I look for a chew that is low in calories, high in protein, made from natural ingredients and promotes fresh breath. Natural and hypoallergenic chews are available if your dog has food allergies or intolerances. If your dog has specific dietary requirements, please read the ingredients carefully."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqysp2Wjmrmmr9OsZmtoaWuCc4OPaJmeq6RisbCzjJ2cp6yRoXqktMSwqmatm2Q%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./storage-wars-bidder-mark-balelo-commits-suicide.html><span>←</span><span>'Storage Wars' Bidder Mark Balelo Commits Suicide</span></a>
