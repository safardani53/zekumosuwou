The <a href=#>three Lawrence brothers</a> — Joey, Matthew and Andrew, respectively — are no strangers to <a href=#>showcasing their sibling connection in real life or on the big screen.</a></p><p class=p1>Brothers in real life, they <a href=#>also played onscreen siblings</a> in NBC’s short-lived sitcom<i>&nbsp;Brotherly Love</i>&nbsp;from 1995 to 1997. (The second and final season <a href=#>aired via The WB</a>.) The comedy followed eldest brother Joe Roman (<a href=#><strong>Joey Lawrence</strong></a>) when he returned to his hometown of Philadelphia one year after his father’s death. Intending to cash out his share of the family business, he soon realized that the company — and his two younger half-brothers Matt (<a href=#><strong>Matthew Lawrence</strong></a>) and Andy (<strong>Andrew Lawrence</strong>) — needed his help.</p><p class=p1>“I get flashbacks all the time with these guys,” the&nbsp;<a href=#><i>Blossom&nbsp;</i></a>alum told&nbsp;<i><a href=#>The Los Angeles Times</a>&nbsp;</i>in September 1995 of working with his younger brothers. “I was&nbsp;always&nbsp;being told to speak more slowly. I’m kind of in-between them, personality-wise. … Matt’s the quietest [and] I don’t know how Andy got so outgoing.”</p><p class=p1>The siblings — who also <a href=#>costarred in Disney Channel’s&nbsp;<i>Horse Sense&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>Jumping Ship</i></a>&nbsp;— portrayed fictional brothers, whose scenarios heavily echoed their real life. Decades later, the trio reunited on the small screen for several episodes of <a href=#>Freeform’s&nbsp;<i>Melissa & Joey</i>,</a> which starred Joey and <a href=#><strong>Melissa Joan Hart</strong></a>.</p><p class=p1>“The [Lawrence] family’s pretty amazing to work with,” <strong>Melinda Culea</strong>, who <a href=#>played&nbsp;<i>Brotherly Love</i>&nbsp;TV mom Claire</a>, told&nbsp;<i>The Los Angeles Times&nbsp;</i>in September 1995. “There have never been any problems with them all on the set. It actually makes things flow easier.”</p><p class=p1>While the Philadelphia natives’ show <a href=#>only lasted two seasons</a>, they have since been <a href=#>candid about a potential reboot as adults</a>.</p><p class=p1>“You know what’s so funny? When you actually get time to think about things, [I remembered] one of my representatives called me and said, ‘Hey, would you and your brothers think about this?’ I had a long conversation,” the&nbsp;<a href=#><i>Boy Meets World&nbsp;</i></a>alum <a href=#>exclusively told<i>&nbsp;Us Weekly&nbsp;</i>in April 2020</a> about the potential for a new version of the sitcom. “We’re talking to one of the creators from that show and they were talking about it.”</p><p class=p1>Matthew added at the time: “The conversation was literally, yesterday, just brought back up to me. I don’t know. I know we’d all love to do it. It’s just, I guess, timing. Timing is everything.”</p><p class=p1>While an official&nbsp;<i>Brotherly Love&nbsp;</i>revival has not been made as of 2022, the Lawrences have continued working together onscreen.</p><p class=p1>“We’re actually working on a TV&nbsp;show together for the first time in 15 years,” Joey&nbsp;previously told&nbsp;<i><a href=#>Entertainment Tonight</a>&nbsp;</i>in December 2017 of a forthcoming project they were developing at the time.&nbsp;“We wanted to find a way&nbsp;not to redo&nbsp;<i>Brotherly Love</i>, but to bring us back together as grown men. It’s edgy, which is different. The dynamic and relationships that we have are not the late ’90s, sitcom-like relationships.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>Scroll below to catch up with the&nbsp;<i>Brotherly Love&nbsp;</i>cast more than 20 years since its premiere:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BXv7DAx56ppbFdoby3sYycmKysXay1pr7EZpirnV2ptabFjKemsGc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./beyonces-most-controversial-moments-over-the-years.html><span>←</span><span>Beyonces Most Controversial Moments Over the Years</span></a>
