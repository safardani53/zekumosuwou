Case in point: The Burt's Bees Renewal Firming Moisturizing Cream is one of the best face moisturizers with anti-aging benefits we’ve ever tried. This face cream is particularly great for someone who is more sensitive to retinol and looking to try a retinol alternative since its formulated with bakuchiol, a natural ingredient with similar benefits.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It also features vitamin E as a key ingredient which is highly nourishing, rich in antioxidants, and protects the skin from aggressors that provoke premature signs of aging.

This is especially true when it comes to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>SPF makeup</a>.

But, that’s not even its most impressive feature. In addition to sun protection, the full-coverage CC cream is also infused with hydrolyzed collagen, peptides, and niacinamide, which are key anti-aging ingredients that promote a more supple, youthful-looking complexion. If you’re going to wear something on your face all day, it might as well work for you — not just in looks but in performance — and this anti-aging makeup product works.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>1.08 oz. | <strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Hydrolyzed collagen, peptides, niacinamide</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-powder-sunscreen-isdin-isdinceutics-mineral-brush></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Powder Sunscreen</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>ISDIN Mineral Brush</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="ISDIN Isdinceutics Mineral Brush" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/Q1xVD_FF75rT-rR__Dc3aXF_4XA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/isdin-isdinceutics-mineral-brush-28f5bedf66db4e458afa5c469136cbe8.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The sun is a major aggressor when it comes to anti-aging skincare, especially since it can be blamed for causing premature signs of aging. With that in mind, applying sunscreen every day is a non-negotiable — not just for looks but also for skin health and protection. That being said, slathering lotion on top of a face of makeup is a bit tricky, which is why <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>powder sunscreens</a> offer a great alternative.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This ISDIN Isdinceutics Mineral Brush comes highly <a href=# class=pseudoStyle data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>recommended by PEOPLE testers</a> because it’s both an effective sunscreen and an anti-aging product with key ingredients such as titanium dioxide, zinc oxide, mica, and iron oxides to keep free radicals caused by the sun, pollution, and even blue light at bay.

In addition to SPF, sun protective ingredients also include antioxidants like vitamin C, which can protect the complexion from environmental aggressors that impact aging, including the sun’s harmful UV rays and pollution.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Skin Type&nbsp;</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“Consider your skin type when shopping for anti-aging products as some products may be too harsh for sensitive skin, while others may not provide enough moisture for dry skin,” says Dr. Tonkovic-Capin.

He adds that, while price doesn’t always indicate effectiveness, it’s important to consider your budget and how much you’re willing to spend — after all, you’ll eventually need to restock.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-faq-46b07725-ef7a-43f9-ae59-5e1a28251d8b></span><p>Frequently Asked Questions</p><ul id=mntl-sc-block-faq__content_1-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block-faq__content mntl-accordion" readability=49.253092293054><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-0.90579710144928><p><span class=accordion__title>Do any creams actually get rid of wrinkles?</span></p><p>Not all anti-aging creams are created equal, which means not all of them will target the look of wrinkles. According to Dr. Tonkovic-Capin, some creams, especially formulas with retinol (like the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Paula’s Choice Intensive Repair Cream</a>) can eliminate fine wrinkles over several months of use. “Still, no cream will eliminate all wrinkles,” Dr. Tonkovic-Capin adds.&nbsp;</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>When should I start using anti-aging products?</span></p><p>“The introduction of cosmeceuticals that target aging can be started at any age, but generally we recommend them around 25 to 30 years of age,” says Dr. Skotnicki. However, some circumstances — such as where you live — can influence when to start using anti-aging products. “If you live in a major city where pollution is high or live near the equator where the UV index is higher, starting an anti-aging product should occur even earlier due to the increased oxidative stress associated with pollution and UV exposure, which are the main drivers of skin aging,” Dr. Skotnicki adds.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>Are there any side effects from using retinol?</span></p><p>When new to retinol, Smith says that most people will experience some slight skin irritation and even breakouts; however, this usually subsides after a month of use. “Retinol binds to receptors in the skin and this leads to activation of skin turnover [which] can lead to dryness and skin irritation,” Dr. Skotnicki further explains. Retinol can also make your skin more sensitive to the sun and is therefore recommended that you use it at night and apply sunscreen during the day.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-0.935546875><p><span class=accordion__title>Is it possible to use too much anti-aging product?</span></p><p>“You can’t overdo anti-aging lotions and creams, but it is possible to use too much retinol,” says Smith. For <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>over-the-counter retinol formulas</a>, she recommends starting gradually one to two times a week, then increasing as your skin adapts. “If you use a retinol-based product as well as a chemical exfoliation product together, you are also over-doing it and most likely stripping your skin’s natural barrier, creating skin issues like irritation.”</p></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-take-our-word-for-it></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Take Our Word For It</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Jessie Quinn</a> is a contributing commerce writer for PEOPLE and has written for publications such as Byrdie, InStyle, The Spruce, NYLON, and more.
