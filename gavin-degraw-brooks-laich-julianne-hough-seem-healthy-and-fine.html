An insider added that “everyone knows something is up.”</p><p>Laich first sparked rocky relationship rumors when <a href=#>he wrote via Instagram</a> that he was “working on becoming a better man, a better version of me” in 2020 on December 30.</p><p>A day later, the professional dancer was spotted without her wedding ring while cohosting NBC’s New Year’s Eve with <a href=#><strong>Carson Daly</strong></a> on December 31.

The following week, Laich told Us that men can be just as emotional as women.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Gavin-DeGraw-Brooks-Laich-Julianne-Hough-Are-Healthy-and-Fine-3.jpg><p>“We don’t know the answer, we don’t have the way out,” the “How Men Think” podcast host <a href=#>told Us on January 18</a>, about men in general. “Our emotions are real and we’re in it with our partner, our friend, whatever. And I think that’s a vulnerability that men maybe don’t show enough. It’s OK to say ‘I don’t know,‘ it’s OK to say ‘I’m scared too.‘ It’s OK to say those kinds of things that men may sometimes put on a facade and maybe pretend that they have everything figured out or handled, or it doesn’t phase them.”</p><p>On January 23, Hough’s brother, <a href=#><strong>Derek Hough</strong></a>, told Us exclusively that <a href=#>his sister was killing it at the moment</a> amid the relationship drama. “Julianne? Have you seen her lately? She’s having a blast,” Derek, 34, told Us at the time. “She’s on tour right now. She’s crushing it, man. She’s destroying it.”</p><p>The World of Dance judge also hyped up his brother-in-law saying, “I love Brooks, he’s my boy. My boy. He kicks my butt at ping pong all the damn time.”</p><p>Despite not knowing the inner workings of Laich and Julianne’s relationship, DeGraw told Us on Friday that watching his cohost on air — building a life after hockey — has been “great to see.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“He’s got a great talent for it,” the New York native said of Laich. “He’s got a great knack for it, lovely guy. So just seeing that evolution as a friend is beautiful. It is beautiful to watch. And I say it’s nice to get in a room with people who are willing to share intimate details about their emotions.”</p><p>With reporting by Nicole Pajer</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGagmaaeu26wxKCpmq9dl7%2Bwu8qsZKWZmZi1brbUpaCapp6aeqm71KCfZquVmrputMSao62gqWKur7CMn6CnnV8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-collins-key-dating.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Collins Key Dating Now</span></a>
