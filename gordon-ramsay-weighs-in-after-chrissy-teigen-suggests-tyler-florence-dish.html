<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>Gordon Ramsay Weighs In After Chrissy Teigen Suggests Tyler Florence Dish</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><a href=#><strong>Chrissy Teigen</strong></a> is in a bit of a pickle! The star posed a question to her millions of Twitter followers on Thursday, August 15, that may have gotten her on <strong>Gordon Ramsay</strong>’s bad side. Allow Us to explain.</p><p>The Bring the Funny host took to the social media platform to ask her fans if there’s a dish they have never eaten “but probably should have by now?” To get the ball rolling, Teigen, 33, offered her answers first. “Mine is *still* pastrami on rye and also, bagel with lox/smoked salmon,” she replied.</p><p>For one follower, the elusive dish in question is Beef Wellington, which she noted is 52-year-old Ramsay’s fault since she’s been craving the British staple since the celebrity chef’s show, Hell’s Kitchen, premiered in 2005.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Gordon-Ramsay-Weighs-in-After-Chrissy-Teigen-Sugests-Tyler-Florence-Dish-1.jpg><p>Despite the mention of Ramsay’s name, Teigen replied to her follower with a suggestion involving a different famous cook. “So easy to make and perfect,” the Cravings author wrote back. “Make the one online from Tyler Florence!”</p><p>Believe it or not, Teigen’s (seemingly) unintentional snub was enough to get Ramsay’s attention. “Ouch,” the MasterChef host tweeted in response. “That stings …”</p><p>Realizing the error of her ways, Teigen promptly went into damage control mode. “I HAVENT MADE YOURS YET GORDON,” she shot back. The cookbook author then proposed a compromise, adding: “I will make yours this Christmas. We will switch every year between you and Tyler like divorced parents.”</p><p>Still, despite having a reasonable solution in mind, the cookware creator seemed intimidated by Ramsay, who is known for his harsh critiques and profanity-laced tirades. When a follower suggested Teigen and the Brit team up to cook for a YouTube video, she wasn’t exactly on board. More specifically, the Lip Sync Battle cohost answered: “No he’s gonna yell at me. I am too anxious!!”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Still, getting Teigen and Ramsay together might not be a bad idea, especially given the Utah native’s history with Beef Wellington. Though she makes Florence’s “incredible” version of the dish “every Christmas,” according to a <a href=#>tweet</a> from December 2018, when she prepared Beef Wellington back in April as part of an Easter spread, it didn’t exactly go as planned.</p><p>“Just an update on this Wellington: it was terrible,” she tweeted at the time. “I forgot to sauté the mushrooms so they juiced all over the place. The bottom was crazy soggy and the oven was way off. So yeah. It looks good but it sucked. Oh well. Next time.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmn6efmXyvsdasZqCnopm8r3nRmqSsmalixKa1xqGqZqGeYq6nwMSrZJygop7AtMWMrZyin5WjerTBxqCcrKyjYsG6uMSrZJ%2Bkn6eyr6%2FEZpuiq5hk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./gavin-degraw-brooks-laich-julianne-hough-seem-healthy-and-fine.html><span>←</span><span>Gavin DeGraw: Brooks Laich, Julianne Hough Seem Healthy and Fine</span></a>
