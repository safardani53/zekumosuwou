Everyone deserves a second chance. She also glorifies drug use. She is very immature and clearly has never received proper guidance.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>User <strong>ceasarscissorhand</strong> wrote, “You’ve reached a new low. I guess hating on someone cause they look good as hell while you still look a mess.” <strong>Lindamarx763</strong> commented, “Really Miley?????? Grow up!!!! (…and I like you…very disappointed in you).”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5><img decoding=async src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hollywoocom-20&l=pf4&o=1" alt width=1 height=1 border=0 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p id=content-paragraph-6>One user went so far as to call Miley “tasteless” for posting the photos. “Doesn’t matter if it’s old. People are mad because Jodie can interpret this as disrespect, especially since she’s rising again as a star and clean,” <strong>Pinkisthenewblack</strong> wrote on Instagram.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7><img decoding=async src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hollywoocom-20&l=pf4&o=1" alt width=1 height=1 border=0 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Miley has a habit of posting racy photos on Instagram. It’s kind of her thing. Some of Miley’s fans are coming to her defense over the photos. User <strong>sabi.hernandez</strong> commented, “I don’t think she meant any harm posting this pic tbh.” Another wrote, “Lmao everyones so mad at this but all she said was mood?? Its not like she took the pics.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Miley probably didn’t realize people would have such a problem with the photos, but maybe she should think twice before posting such personal pics. Jodie has been very open about her drug and alcohol problems in the past. After using drugs like meth, cocaine and ecstasy, Jodie finally got clean. Jodie’s come such a long way! We’re so proud of her.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10><strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>, do you think Miley went too far?
