The theme this year is <a href=#>Karl Lagerfeld: A Line of Beauty</a>, and the runway model delivered drama in a sequined bodysuit with her sleeves cascading into a train.</p><p>The back of the piece was finished in a thong and her collar included a<a href=#> silver bedazzled design</a>. Jenner teamed the look up with Lorraine Schwartz jewelry. Her boots commanded attention just as much as the bodysuit did. The platform heels were finished with a matching crystal design and lace-up details.</p><p>For glam, the supermodel dazzled Us with <a href=#>natural makeup</a>. She sported subtle contour, blushed cheeks, warm eyeshadow shades, long lashes, filled in brows and glossy lips. The California native completed the outfit with her tresses in a slicked back ponytail.</p><p>Jenner always slays the red carpet at the Met Gala. In <a href=#>May 2022</a>, the brunette beauty took our breath away in a Prada dress. The bodice of the frock was sheer and finished with beaded embellishments. The poofy skirt of her dress cascaded behind her in a ruffled train.</p><p>The reality star arrived alongside famous sisters<a href=#> <strong>Kylie Jenner</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Kourtney Kardashian</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Khloé Kardashian</strong></a> and was almost unrecognizable thanks to her glam last year. The influencer <a href=#>bleached her brows</a> for the event and wore edgy eyeshadow. To top the look off, she parted her hair down the middle and styled it in beachy waves.</p><p>Although she always looks ultra-glamorous at fashion’s biggest night, the socialite has admitted to not always being comfortable in her outfits. At her first gala in 2014, Jenner wore a pearly dress by Topshop featuring a mermaid fit and strapless neckline. In a September 2022 interview with <a href=#>Vogue</a>, she revealed, “I remember driving to the Met and … I had to lay in the back seat because my corset underneath was so tight.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>She continued to reminisce about her look at the September 2021 gala and explained that even though the Givenchy <a href=#>bedazzled gown</a> “turned out perfectly,” it was “extremely heavy.” She continued, “I won’t lie, I wasn’t the most comfortable person all night, but it was so worth it.”</p><p>Keep scrolling to see Jenner’s stellar looks at the 2023 Met Gala:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6poJyspaeytHvMnqtmn5Ghrm5%2Bj2tqZqOVo7GiuMtmoZ6mnpq%2Fbq7RoqWgq12dsqLAjKKlZpqfmca0wcitZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./john-stamos-was-shattered-after-rebecca-romijn-divorce-exclusive-8362803.html><span>←</span><span>John Stamos Was 'Shattered' After Rebecca Romijn Divorce (Exclusive)</span></a>
