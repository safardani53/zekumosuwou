When I was 12 years old, I cut my hair to look like Chynna Philips, except I didn’t look like Chynna Philips, that is.</p><p>2. I won’t run unless chased, so … I dance. The Tracy Anderson Method is the way to go for me. If I had it my way, I’d go five times a week.</p><p>3. My dream would be to dance and sing like <b>Beyoncé</b>. In my mind, I am radiant while performing at Madison Square Garden! In the mirror, the previous sentence is not true.</p><p>4. I love my husband [Honest Company cofounder <b>Christopher Gavigan</b>]’s intelligence. He’s handsome, kind and wholehearted. As a husband and father he is all in.</p><p>5. I can do many different accents, but I cannot for the life of me master the Aussie one. Doesn’t stop Camilla [Luddington], who has a perfect accent, from trying to help me-slash-make fun of me.</p><p>6. I’m a Leo, so I’m fiercely loyal. And I appreciate a great mane.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/686532092_cher-zoom-9065111c-d2d4-4a06-9bc2-fcd2c58461e4.jpg><p>7. I do a mean <b>Cher</b> impression to her song “If I Could Turn Back Time.”</p><p>8. I’m competitive! Don’t play me in ping-pong because even if I don’t get the most points, I will find a way to win the game.</p><p>9. During college [at Brown University], I studied in Florence, Italy, and became fluent in Italian. I am not currently fluent in Italian. Molto not bueno.</p><p>10. <b>Taylor Swift </b>and I became friendly at first because she’s a fan of <i>Grey’s Anatomy</i>. And I will remind my kids of this fact when they get older and try to pretend like I’m not super cool.</p><p>11. I’m a big <i>Jerry Maguire</i> fan. When my husband and I started dating, I made him watch it and just sat next to him staring at him to make sure he really “got it.”</p><p>12. Two songs on a loop in my car: “Thunder” by Imagine Dragons and “Feel it still” by Portugal the Man. I dare you to try and get my attention at a stoplight while that’s playing.</p><p>13. I’m quite pleased with the resurgence of Levi’s. There’s nothing that looks better than a great pair of 501s.</p><p>14. Procrastinating is a habit I wish I could kick. I’m getting around to stopping it.</p><p>15. My most embarrassing moment was falling off a six-inch platform heel on a red carpet while wearing a skirt. Enough said.</p><p>16. I’ve “fangirled” over<b> Michelle Obama</b>. She’s perfect: intelligent, passionate, beautiful and inspirational as a mother and professional.</p><p>17. Growing up, I crushed hard on Michael J. Fox. I love a funny guy.</p><p>18. I always win the first round of Rock, Paper, Scissors.</p><p>19. I’m addicted to <i>Game of Thrones</i>. Watching Khaleesi has made my hair three shades lighter and my eyebrows three shades darker. Fingers crossed for a baby dragon this Christmas!</p><p>20. Sandwiches are my favorite kind of food and I spend countless amounts of time perfecting their construction.</p><p>21. I cannot abide people who are unkind, rude, stingy, sexist, racist or just plain mean. I could add more but those are the big ones.</p><p>22. My favorite role is Arizona! To play a character for nine years, know her inside and out and have people connect to her is beyond thrilling.</p><p>23. I specialize in downhill hiking.</p><p>24. I have a self-diagnosed “photographic memory” and this helps me learn my lines in a minute (thank goodness!) and reeeeeally irritates <b>Justin Chambers</b>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>25. I have 10 brothers and sisters.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajnaOotqStjJyYqauYlsRufpRmq6GhnpzAbsXOrmSdp56peqy6zrBkmpqfqsFuucRmrm5oZWWAd3s%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./inder-chahal.html><span>←</span><span>Inder Chahal- Wiki, Age, Height, Net Worth, Girlfriend, Ethnicity</span></a>
