Certainly the pregnancy was unplanned.</p><p>"It took a while for us both to adjust to the situation but I am now absolutely clear about what I want. I am in love with Michelle and want to marry her.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in TV</h2></p><p>"I am thrilled and excited at the prospect of becoming a father. And I want to marry Michelle as soon as I can - before the baby is born if possible."</p><p>But, just weeks later, Michelle made the heartbreaking revelation that she had lost their baby.</p><p>A spokesperson for the couple at the time said: "Michelle and Syed are both extremely upset and are currently supporting each other through this difficult period."</p><p>Shortly afterwards Syed confirmed he and Michelle had split, saying: "It's almost as though you've lost something more than a baby. You've lost a part of your chemistry, too."</p><p>Syed is still in the business world and his website describes him as a public speaker, presenter and a fundraiser for charities.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/home_banner-entrepreneurjpg-JS703471496.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Dl79DdPUwAA3wgkjpg-JS703469935.jpg> <span class=article__bc_video-caption>Syed Ahmed gets fired on The Apprentice in 2006</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jq2taGlnZ396hI9qZq2glWKusbzRnqWtoZOaerTFxJ1kmqCdmrFuus6wZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ted-cruz-likes-incest-porn-on-twitter-internet-has-a-field-day.html><span>←</span><span>Ted Cruz &amp;quot;Likes&amp;quot; Incest Porn on Twitter; Internet Has a Field Day</span></a>
