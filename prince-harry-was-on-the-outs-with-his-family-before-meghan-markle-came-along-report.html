Wales,” Levin said this week.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/05/GettyImages-1252743578-758x1024.jpg><p>“He wasn’t Prince Harry. He loved being out in Afghanistan. He was brought back because someone leaked that he was there, and it became too dangerous for him and the soldiers.”</p><p>Levin has often been highly critical of Meghan, but she shares the belief that the Duchess was not the sole motivating force behind Harry’s decision to retire from the life of a working royal.</p><p>According to Pelham Turner, both of the Sussexes felt confined by royal life, and in each other, they found the strength to break out on their own.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>“Ultimately, both are very strong-willed characters who felt the only answer was to escape the royal straitjacket,” said Pelham Turner.</p><p>“Being the ‘spare’ meant to strike on into new pastures where they both felt confident to have a simpler and family-friendly lifestyle,” he continued.</p><p>“Meghan is a strong character who would have given moral support with the decision to move to America. That, in my estimation, gave Harry the determination to move with the times.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/08/GettyImages-1409487825-1024x683.jpg><p>The evidence suggests more and more that even if he had married someone else or remained single, Harry still would have stepped away from royal life.</p><p>Sadly, the British tabloid press will almost certainly continue to blame Meghan for the current strife within the Windsor clan.</p><p>T</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2trX2WCcLzRoqWcnV2drrO%2B2GaumqtdpLtuwMeeZKitpKh6uLXToWShoaNis6K5yKWwZpqVm7yzsYymnKCgkaN6rq3RpKOeZZOWuqZ5wKWmp59dp7Kxu9GtZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./deray-mckesson.html><span>←</span><span>Fame | DeRay Mckesson net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</span></a>
