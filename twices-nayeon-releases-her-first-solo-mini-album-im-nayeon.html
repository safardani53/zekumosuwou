<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>TWICEs Nayeon Releases Her First Solo Mini-Album IM NAYEON</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Naeyeon, the world-famous K-pop star TWICE, made waves on the internet with the recent release of her debut solo mini-album IM NAYEON. The K-pop singer made her solo debut as the first member of her group. Fans are clearly smitten with her vibrant, energy-packed compact album.&nbsp;Nayeon clearly exhibited her bubbly attitude and girl crush charms with the title song, POP, as the song is a testimony to the singer’s sweet voice.</p><p>In a recent interview with Vulture, Nayeon revealed the strange method she found out about her solo debut. She also added that the enthusiasm came with a lot of pressure since people were looking forward to the group’s individual endeavors. According to Nayeon:</p><p>“It seemed surreal at first. I also felt a little pressed. I knew that since I’d been working in a team for so long, many people had been anticipating and looking forward to this.”</p><h2>TWICE’s Nayeon becomes the group’s first solo debutant in the group’s seven-year tenure</h2><p>Following TWICE’s spectacular seven-year journey, it was only a matter of time before the members of the band began creating their own solo albums. Because groupmate Nayeon was the first to be chosen for the lineup, her company, JYP Entertainment, felt it was only fair for her to begin her solo project.</p><p>On June 24, the idol released her maiden mini-album IM NAYEON, which included the title tune POP. Nayeon’s bright and cheery attitude shone through the whole track, and her joyful, upbeat melodies and dynamic choreography wowed fans. Although the vocalist is used to sharing the stage with her bandmates, she shines brightly when performing alone.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Nayeon-2.jpg alt=Nayeon width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The members of the group had a busy year traveling across the world for their III World Tour, which ran from December 2021 to May 2022. Instead of enjoying a well-deserved vacation, Nayeon threw herself into making her solo album and arranging marketing.</p><p>Nayeon recently discussed her solo debut with Vulture and announced her new endeavor as a solo artist. While K-pop singers discuss their solo ventures with their agencies, it seems that Nayeon’s solo debut caught her off guard. The singer noted that she just became aware of it when JYP Entertainment revealed TWICE’s yearly schedule:</p><p>“I discovered I had a solo album coming out in June when they gave us the completed plan for this year.”</p><p>Nayeon explained that, although her solo album was surprising, it was something she had been planning for quite some time. The singer said that her fellow group members were immensely pleased and delighted for her when she made her solo debut:</p><p>“When the members found out about my solo, they all praised me as if it were the release of a Twice album. They had a lot of faith in me and were thrilled for me.”</p><p>Fans may anticipate more solo projects from the members in the future, according to Nayeon:</p><p>“I believe that the other members will have more chances in the future to showcase their respective talents as solo artists.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Nayeon-1.jpg alt=Nayeon width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Meanwhile, TWICE, the worldwide K-pop superstar has dazzled fans with their great performances and beautiful ensembles since their debut in 2015.&nbsp;The nine-member female group rose to fame with their distinctive abilities and conceptions, accompanied by girl crush feelings, and is still one of the most prominent K-pop exponents in the music business.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGirsKGTmsBuusCynKimXaeyrbHArJysZZiav26yyKuqrWWjpLmwecyipaJlkaGvtrmMoqRmppGusrC6jg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./stephen-brown-7f2z-html.html><span>←</span><span>Stephen Brown (TikTok Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</span></a>
