Montero arrived on Friday, and along with it came a sexy (and heartbreaking) video for “That’s What I Want”.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>In the video above, Lil Nas X falls in love with a sexy football player. They have some steamy shower sex before retreating to the outback for some one-on-one fun in their tent. Later, the rapper goes knocking on the man’s door only to find out that he’s already married to a woman. It’s such an act of betrayal and Lil Nas X is left burying his sorrows with alcohol. It’s heartbreaking to watch, but such a great song.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Montero marks the end of one journey for Lil Nas X, and the start of the next chapter of this remarkable career. The man born <strong>Montero Lamar Hill </strong>rode onto the pop culture landscape in 2018, when he first released “Old Town Road.” While leasing a beat he leased for $30, Nas X pieced together the lyrics that would make him a phenomenon. “I’m just following the melody of the beginning, and then the line just comes to me,” he told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>CBS News</a> in 2019. “Yeah, ‘I’m gonna take my horse to Old Town Road.’ … I wanted to paint a picture of, like, a depressed kind of cowboy going to a better life,” he said. “I wanted it to be, like, a sad-leaning song in the beginning — but then just kinda turn into a banger, you know?”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>The song began to gain traction thanks to the memes Nas X made to promote the song, a Red Dead Redemption compilation video, and a viral challenge on TikTok. The initial success of the song resulted in Nas X landing a record deal with Columbia. In March 2019, <strong>Justin Bieber </strong>tweeted that he loved the song. Shortly afterward, Billboard controversially removed “<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Old Town Road</a>” from the Hot Country Songs Chart, under the idea that it “does not embrace enough elements of today’s country music to chart in its current version. This prompted a spike in streams as irate fans voiced support for Lil Nas X, prompting it to hit No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 on April 13, 2019. <strong>Billy Ray Cyrus </strong>joined on the first remix, and from there, the song made history. It spent a record-breaking nineteen consecutive weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard 100. Numerous remixes followed – including ones featuring <strong>Diplo, Young Thug, Mason Ramsey, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>BTS</a>, </strong>and more.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/lil-nas-x-prewrite-shutterstock-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>Lil Nas X then defied the “one hit wonder” status with 7, his debut EP that officially included “Old Town Road.” His second single, “Panini,” reached No. 5 on the Hot 100, and the release also confirmed his sexuality. Subsequent releases “<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Rodeo</a>” and “<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Holiday</a>” reached the Top 40, but it would be “<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Montero (Call Me By Your Name)</a>” that would prove Lil Nas X was no fluke – and no joke. Released with a video that saw Lil Nas X cast out of the Garden of Eden, only to pole dance down to Hell where he gave the Devil a lapdance (before ultimately killing him), “Montero” faced a huge backlash from mostly conservative and thinly-veiled homophobic <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>critics</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>These commentators took umbrage at a black gay man grinding on Satan in a music video. The controversy only seemed to make Lil Nas X stronger. Not only did he take it in stride (earning him the reputation of being unbeatable when it comes to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>trolling</a> and clapping-back), “Montero” hit No. 1 on the Hot 100, and has since gone double-platinum. The follow-up, “<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Sun Goes Down</a>” (with its autobiographical video), peaked at No. 66, but the third single, “<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Industry Baby</a>” (featuring <strong>Jack Harlow</strong>), hit No. 2.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/lil-nas-x-prewrite-shutterstock-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-9>At the start of September 2021, Lil Nas X revealed the tracklisting for Montero, as well <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>as the album art.</a> Boasting features from <strong>Megan Thee Stallion, Miley Cyrus, Doja Cat, </strong>and <strong>Elton John, </strong>the album was poised to be a hit long before it was released. That didn’t stop Lil Nas X from still trolling his <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>detractors</a>. By donning a prosthetic baby bump and saying he was “pregnant” with the album, Nas X subverted gender attitudes while, seemingly, having the time of his life.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>Since the success of “Old Town Road” and the coming-out that occurred with 7, Lil Nas X has been open and proud of his identity. He’s also been a welcomed presence on red carpets, bringing eye-catching fashion and dramatic moments to normally stuffed and sanitized industry events.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>Now, with the release of Montero, the album’s namesake – who just turned 22 this year – is ready to start the next phase of his career. It wouldn’t be too farfetched to call Montero a victory lap, since it shows that Lil Nas X had a lot more in him than “Old Town Road,” but that would also assume that the race is over. If Lil Nas X has proved anything, it’s that he’s just getting started.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH16e5BwZqWhnGK7or%2BMsWStoJGpwG7Dx5qrZqFdrK6vwIyvoJ2dn2LAqbvWnqlmq5WteqS0xJqroqaXZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./leaving-neverland-michael-jackson-accuser-wade-robson-7-things-to-know.html><span>←</span><span>Leaving Neverland's Wade Robson: Facts About Michael Jackson's Accuser</span></a>
