It was very<br>unusual.</i></p><p>“Given the prominence he holds within organised crime in Scotland, we welcome this sentence.</p><p>“It demonstrates to people like David McKenzie that we don’t care who they are — we will use every means available to haul them to justice.”</p><p>Cops in the former Scottish Crime and Drug Enforcement Agency knew for years that McKenzie, was a major player in the criminal underworld.</p><p>But the key lieutenant of Stevenson, who was jailed in 2007 for laundering £1million of drugs cash, popped up on their radar again in November 2010 as they mounted Operation Chilon, targeting a central Scotland crime gang.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/1814082.main_image.jpg><p>Detectives knew the villains were buying high-quality cocaine from gangsters in Liverpool and Manchester and selling it heavily cut to users across Scotland.</p><p><i>They linked McKenzie — who insists on being called ‘Rambo’ — to a flat in Glasgow’s Dennistoun that was being used as a “cutting shop” to bulk out batches of 77 per cent pure coke with mixing agents such as benzocaine, often used in over-the-counter medicines.</i></p><p>The East End crime base was later raided and associate Benjamin Welsh, 49, was jailed. But police decided to carry on watching McKenzie.</p><p>DCI Donaldson said: “It was clear to us he was a prominent figure in that crime group.</p><p>“We already knew, as did most people, that he was a long-standing member of organised crime.</p><p>“We wanted to attack everything that this group was involved in — not only the drugs but also any businesses.”</p><p>Detectives made a breakthrough when they realised McKenzie was heavily involved in day-to-day drugs transactions.</p><p>They watched in disbelief as he met shady Liverpool gangsters in hotels such as the upmarket Radisson Blu in Glasgow city centre — evidence that helped them to build a rock solid case against him. DCI Donaldson has no idea why McKenzie was involved in his business at this level.</p><p>He said: “If you have a directing influence in a crime group, as he had, you don’t get involved in actually distributing the drugs.</p><p>“People in that position usually operate at arm’s length to make it harder for us to detect them.</p><p>“I can only assume some people prefer to be hands-on. For him, the temptation to be involved was too strong. It was most unusual.”</p><p>Police moved on McKenzie in June 2011 and raided his house in Baillieston, Glasgow.</p><p>He fled to Spain and was only arrested in February after being picked up off a flight from Malaga to Belfast.</p><p>His trial heard how bugs in McKenzie’s Mercedes and Mazda recorded him discussing drugs deals and profits with associates.</p><p>He used code words such as “scratch” — meaning a sample of coke for potential customers — in a bid to outwit cops if they were listening in. Prosecutor<br>Bill McVicar revealed: “He demonstrated a high level of awareness of police<br>activity and adopted anti-surveillance techniques.” Gordon Jackson, defending, described him as “a lieutenant of people who are very serious in the business”.</p><p>The court heard police seized 18 kilos of 77 per cent pure cocaine. The average purity on the street is 12 per cent.</p><p><i>McKenzie avoided a 10-year sentence as he admitted being involved in cocaine hauls with a street value of £920,000.</i></p><p>But DCI Donaldson said: “The amount of cocaine seized could have generated £5million on the streets.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/1814081.main_image.jpg><p>Jailing McKenzie for six years and eight months for his third drugs rap, judge Lord Matthews said: “Those who deal in controlled drugs can expect very<br>little mercy.”</p><p>Cocky McKenzie smiled and waved to the officers who caught him as he was led handcuffed from court.</p><p>The SCDEA is now part of Police Scotland’s Specialist Crime Division. And DCI Donaldson appealed to the public for help in nailing more major criminals.</p><p>He said: “They live a lifestyle some of us can only dream about.”</p><h4>How Mincy was cooked</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/1814251.main_image.jpg><p>NOVEMBER 2010: Cops link McKenzie to “cutting room” in Dennistoun.</p><p>DECEMBER 2010: Seen meeting associate at Radisson Blu.</p><p>JANUARY 2011: McKenzie’s sidekick meets same man in Liverpool — he’s later stopped by cops on M74, who find 2kg coke.</p><p>APRIL 2011: Raid on McKenzie’s home finds Blackberry drug deal texts.</p><p>JUNE 2011: McKenzie flees to Spain.</p><p>FEBRUARY 2013: Arrested after arriving on flight to Belfast.
