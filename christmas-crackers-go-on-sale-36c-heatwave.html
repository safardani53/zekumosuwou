It’s roasting. I know it gets earlier every year but this is just madness.&nbsp;</p><p>“Some people haven’t had a summer holiday yet. They haven’t got Halloween stuff on display which is two months earlier.”&nbsp;</p><p>Unseasonal products up for grabs on Wednesday included a box of £9.99 crackers called “Race to Santa’s Workshop”.</p><p>Store manager Jolyon Martin said: “They’re out on the shop floor because it takes a long time to get these lines up and running — though I admit the timing with the hot weather isn’t that good. At the moment we only have crackers and cards out for sale. They aren’t flying off the shelves.&nbsp;</p><p>“We have had comments both positive and negative about them.”</p><p>Christian Concern chief executive Andrea Williams said: “It may feel a bit crackers but in these unusual times we’re all looking forward to some Christmas cheer.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NINTCHDBPICT000601543942.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NINTCHDBPICT000601541549.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NINTCHDBPICT000601543852.jpg><br><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">The Sun Says</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>IT’S not unusual to be accosted by Christmas music while shopping in November.</p><p>But the Surrey store which stacked its shelves with Xmas goods as we sweltered in a record-breaking run of 34C heat has jumped the gun slightly.</p><p><strong>Our sympathies are with you, Santa.</strong></p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in UK News</h2></p><p>Personal finance experts also believe summer is the time to start Xmas shopping.
