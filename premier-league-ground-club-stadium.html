Rats enjoy the space but that’s all.</p><p>"I don’t get how they can spend millions on players and wages but not sort out the rubbish.&nbsp;</p><p>"Fans fill up our bins as they pass by and they don’t really consider that this is a residential area.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Football</h2></p><p>"They are too busy shouting and screaming.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>"For us it means making sure we know when a game is on so if we have to do any <a href=#>shopping</a>, we do it early."</p><p>Neighbour Fred Rainey, 70, said: "I’ve been here for 40 years and the litter is terrible.</p><p>"All the cones and signs are just left around for the next game and the bins in the park are normally overflowing.&nbsp;</p><p>"Nobody thinks about us residents. They put Motocross on in the stadium during the summer and they had to put down sand and grit down to make it happen.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>"All our windows were covered in dust and about a week later we got a letter from the Council warning us that there might be some dust around.&nbsp;</p><p>"I’m used to it now but it’s not great. Nowadays they close the road from the night before the game so you can’t get a taxi or go out for a pint."</p><h2>PARKING MAD</h2><p>Villa Park opened in 1897 - and was for many years the alternative to <a href=#>Wembley</a> for <a href=#>FA Cup</a> semi-finals.</p><p>Perry Henry, 62, said: "Personally, I love it. They shut the road so there’s no traffic and all you see is fans going up and down. It’s great to be part of it.&nbsp;</p><p>"The bigger disruption we have is from concerts where they don’t close the road and people park wherever they like.&nbsp;</p><p>"They don’t care if they’re blocking people in, they ignore double-yellow lines and leave empty cans on our wall. It’s down to law enforcement.&nbsp;</p><p>"There is no respect today from little kids to grown ups and you’re frightened to say anything.&nbsp;</p><p>"I have heard that Villa want to improve the area, bring in fun areas for kids and clean up the parks.</p><p>"I hope it happens and that the Council’s problems don’t hold it up."</p><h2>MET THEIR MATCH</h2><p>Sarah Bibi, 28, said: "We just get a lot of rubbish, noise and traffic. As soon as Villa are playing we are stuck in the house, sometimes literally because people have just parked across our drive.&nbsp;</p><p>"Some people make a sideline out of it. People hang around wearing bibs so they look like stewards and then offer “protection” for peoples’ cars.</p><p>"We are all massive <a href=#>football</a> fans in our house but it is shocking how dirty the area looks - and you would think the club could do something about it."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Denise Farrell, 63, said: "You literally cannot move round here for <a href=#>cars</a> on match days.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>"I feel sorry for people in wheelchairs because they park up on the curbs and there is no way they can get around.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>"Why can’t Aston Villa do something about it? They’ve got enough money and it’s getting worse.&nbsp;</p><p>"People take no notice of signs, no notice of lines and there’s no need for them to be driving.</p><p>"There are two stations nearby and the number 11 bus which goes all around Birmingham."</p><p>Aston Villa FC has been contacted for comment.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>On its website, the club said: "The area's regeneration will begin with a £100m+ investment in the first phase of improvements to Villa Park.</p><p>"It will contribute an estimated £119.9m to the West Midlands economy each year, creating hundreds of jobs during and post-construction - and attracting 1.65m visitors to the local area annually."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/069e9963-e0e2-49cb-b581-6884e626a7e8.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/leon-images-residents-leaving-next-846026136.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/3e28d22b-4f0d-4789-9107-d28c10f9c5d5.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZH91fJVpaHFoX6W%2FprnInqlmpJWWtLaxjKCpqK2emXqkuNSbZKyskZm2trmO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./miguel-tanfelix.html><span>←</span><span>Miguel Tanfelix</span></a>
