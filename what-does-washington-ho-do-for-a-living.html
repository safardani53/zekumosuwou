According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his LinkedIn</a>, he is the founder of VoltStreet Energy Advisors, a founding shareholder and advisor for Southwestern National Bank, and currently a co-founder of The Real Estate Team, a new business that is presumably a real estate firm.</p><p>Also listed on Washington's LinkedIn is "Head of Ho Activities" for House of Ho. During Season 1, his father was planning on retiring from investment banking, leaving large shoes for the Ho siblings to fill. Many family members, but especially Washington as the eldest son, felt the pressure of living up to their father's expectations.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>However, a large portion of Washington's Season 1 journey was his path toward sobriety, during which he took a step back from his career to spend more time with family and get sober.</p><p>Washington's wife, Lesley, is a pharmacist, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a press release</a> from HBO Max in 2019.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In a since-deleted Instagram post, he wrote, "On Nov. 22, 2019, as the world was watching me on my global platform, I made a decision to give up the drinking and start living. I did it so I could be the best 'Washington Ho' that I know I can be so that I could inspire my kids to stand up for what they feel is right for them."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Now, Washington's sobriety journey has continued into Season 2. He told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ET Online</a>, "[In Season 1] the biggest challenge for me was like, 'Hey, do I continue on my journey and open up and share my personal struggles as an Asian person and as a male, father, a husband? Do I really want to be that vulnerable? Because the comments I got from Season 1 ... I'm thankful for them. Without that, I wouldn't be as inspired to get better and I'm really looking forward to seeing what the fans react to on this season."</p><p>Although Washington's Instagram page is sparse, he did announce that he is also creating music — specifically, a short album created for the House of Ho soundtrack, called "King of Da Ho." The five-track soundtrack is available for listening to on Apple Music, Spotify, and YouTube Music.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What is Washington Ho's net worth?</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Net Worth Gorilla</a>, Washington's net worth value in 2022 is an estimated $250 million.
