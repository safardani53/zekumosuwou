He was born to parents Jeffery L. Cashner and Jane Cashner.</span></p><p><span>He has two siblings. Andrew is the middle one.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Andrew-Cashner-family.jpg><p><span>Jeff Cashner runs a family mortuary business, Cashner Funeral Home & Garden Park Cemetery, in Conroe, Texas, while Jane Casher is a seamstress.</span></p><p><span>Andrew Cashner and his siblings grew up on a 15-acre (6.1 ha) ranch. Andrew learned horseback riding and calf roping on the farm. He was also involved in the local 4-H and Future Farmers of America youth organizations.</span></p><p><span>He has been playing baseball since childhood. Andrew used to practice baseball with his brother and mother on a private regulation-size baseball diamond, constructed by his parents on their property.</span></p><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Miles Mikolas Bio: Wife, Injury, Contract, Net Worth, Stats >></a></strong></p><h3><span>Education and Early Steps Towards Baseball</span></h3><p><span>Casher went to Conroe High School. He graduated from high school in 2005.</span></p><p><span>He was indulged in his high school’s basketball team.</span></p><p><span>The Atlanta Braves drafted him right after high school. But Cashner chose to attend college instead.</span></p><p><span>He went to Angelina College, Lufkin, Texas, and then to Texas Christian University.</span></p><p><span>Cashner was drafted by the Colorado&nbsp;Rockies and Chicago Cubs while in college. However, he only accepted the second offer from the Chicago Cubs, when they made him a first-round draft pick.</span></p><p><strong>You might be interested in reading:</strong>&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Blake Treinen Bio – Dodgers, Contract, Net Worth & Wife >></a></strong></p><h2><span>Andrew Cashner – Minor League Baseball Career</span></h2><p><span>The Chicago Cubs drafted Cashner in the first round, 19th overall, in the 2008 Major League Baseball Draft. He was inducted out of Texas Christian University.</span></p><p><span>Casner was rated the fourth-best candidate before the 2010 season by Baseball America.</span></p><p><span>He played three minor league seasons for the Chicago Cubs. However, he only gave up three home runs.</span></p><h2><span>Andrew Cashner – Major League Baseball Career</span></h2><h3><span>Chicago Cubs</span></h3><p><span>Cashner debuted in the Major league on May 31, 2010, with the Chicago Cubs. He played 53 games as a relief pitcher in the 2010 season.</span></p><p><span>He was named the Chicago Cubs’ 5</span><span>th</span><span> starter on March 26, 2011. However, Cashner could only make one start for the team as he suffered from a rotator cuff injury.</span></p><p><span>A rotator cuff injury causes a severe ache in the shoulder. It’s a nightmare for someone diagnosed with it to have arm movement. A baseball pitcher can’t help himself but quit for a while after suffering it.</span></p><p><span>Hence, Cashner had to take a temporary break from his tournaments.</span></p><p><span>He then returned to the Chicago Cubs in September, as a relief pitcher again.</span></p><p><strong>You might also be interested in reading:</strong>&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Justin Bour Bio: Wife, Net Worth, Team, Contract & MLB >></a></strong></p><h3><span>San Diego Padres</span></h3><p><span>The Chicago Cubs traded Cashner and outfielder Kyung-Min Na with the San Diego Padres on January 6, 2012.

He played 27 games in relief and registered a 3.81 ERA and 29 strikeouts.</span></p><h4><span>2012 Season</span></h4><p><span>He had a short start against the Milwaukee Brewers on June 9, 2012. He was then sent down to increase his arm’s endurance to prepare for a starting role.</span></p><p><span>Cashner made three starts with the AAA St. Antonio Missions of the Minor League. Then, he returned to the Major League on June 28.</span></p><p><span>Soon after, he joined the starting rotation.</span></p><p><span>He again got injured while he had just returned to the San Diego Padres. It was a strain in his right latissimus dorsi muscle.</span></p><p><span>The injury happened while he was warming up for the third inning. The San Diego Padres then placed him on the Disabled List (DL).</span></p><p><span>He returned to the starting line-up on September 7, 2012. However, he had to shut down again after two starts with an injured tendon.</span></p><p><span>The 2012 season did not go well for Cashner. His fastball also went down by 5-8 mph after he returned from the disabled list.</span></p><p><span>He ended the 2012 season with a 3-4 record and a 4.27 ERA with 52 strike-outs in 461⁄3 innings.</span></p><h4><span>2013 Season</span></h4><p><span>Casher again had to go through an injury; this time, he cut the thumb on his pitching hand in a hunting accident.</span></p><p><span>The injury delayed his preparation for the 2013 season. However, he was a member of the San Diego Padres starting rotation by the end of April, after beginning the bullpen season.</span></p><p><span>He recorded his first career home run on July 27, 2013, against the Arizona Diamondbacks pitcher Josh Collmenter.</span></p><p><span>Also, Cashner pitched a one-hit complete-game shutout on September 16 against the Pittsburgh Pirates. He faced 27 batters in minimum at the match.</span></p><p><span>The Pittsburgh Pirates’ lone hit was a single to right field by their outfielder, Jose Tabata, leading off the seventh inning.</span></p><p><span>However, Tabata had to withdraw when <a href=#>Andrew McCutchen</a> of Pittsburgh hit into a double play to end the inning.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Cashner-jersey.jpg><p><span>Cashner recorded 97 pitches and 7 strikeouts and did not walk a batter. The San Diego Padres had a 2-0 victory.</span></p><p><span>Cashner improved his game as the season progressed.

He could not play for about three months of the season owing to elbow, shoulder, and neck injuries.</span></p><p><span>Moreover, Cashner was winless for 11 straight starts despite a 2.86 ERA in that stretch.</span></p><p><span>He then recorded his career-second one-hit shutout on April 11, 2014. It was against the Detroit Tigers.</span></p><p><span>Cashner threw 108 pitches. He also struck out a then career-high 11 batters. In fact, the San Diego Padres had a 6-0 victory.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/andrew-cashner-haircut.jpg><p><span>He built this record after 4 regular seasons of his first one-hitter.</span></p><p><span>Further, he played as a left field for 1 at-bat on April 24, 2014, owing to an emergency. Seth Smith of the San Diego Padres had an injury in an extra-inning game against the Washington Nationals.</span></p><p><span>The San Diego Padres had a 4-3 victory in 12 innings.</span></p><h3><span>Miami Marlins</span></h3><p><span>The San Diego Padres traded Cashner, Colin Rea, and Tayron Guerrero to the Miami Marlins on July 29, 2016.

It was his debut with the Miami Marlins.</span></p><h3><span>Texas Rangers</span></h3><p><span>Cashner agreed to a one-year contract worth $10 million with the Texas Rangers on November 21, 2016.</span></p><p><span>He bounced back from his last few seasons and turned his first season with the Texas Rangers into his strongest one ever.</span></p><p><span>He ended the season with a 3.40 ERA in ​166 2⁄3 innings despite posting a K/BB ratio of 1.34 (86 Ks, 64 BBs).</span></p><p><span>Moreover, Cashner led the Major League pitchers in the highest contact percentage, i.e., 86.4% of batters.</span></p><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nadia Kassem Bio: Mixed Martial Arts, Family, career, & Wiki>></a></strong></p><h3><span>Baltimore Orioles</span></h3><p><span>Cashner signed a two-year worth $16 million with the Baltimore Orioles on February 15, 2018. The contract also included a vesting option for a third year.</span></p><p><span>Cashner again had to struggle with a lower back strain on June 12, 2018. He was then listed in the 10-day disabled category.</span></p><p><span>He had to deal with a couple of DL stints because of injuries in his first season with the Baltimore Orioles.</span></p><p><span>Cashner ended the 2018 season with a 4–15 record in 28 starts. He also had 99 strikeouts in 153 innings.</span></p><p><span>Further, he played 19 games (all starts) with the Baltimore Orioles in 2019.
