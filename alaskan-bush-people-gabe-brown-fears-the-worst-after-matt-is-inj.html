His older brother Matt Brown gets injured.</p><p>It’s a major setback for the Browns, as they explain in this video. How much will this delay construction?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/the-hollywood-gossip-res.cloudinary.com/iu/cs_srgb><p>On Sunday night’s new Alaskan Bush People episode, Matt Brown jumps down from too high and ends up injuring his knee.</p><p>His siblings are concerned about his well being, but as Gabe explains to the camera, they are also concerned about delaying their construction project.</p><p>"These are major setbacks," Gabe laments to the camera.</p><p>He shares his fear that: "It’s gonna keep us from building the barn."</p><p>"It’s pretty much worst case scenario," Gabe worries. Matt may be able to walk, but not like he could before he twisted his knee.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Rain Brown is only 15 (though she often acts as the family’s de facto spokesperson on social media, she will not turn 16 until November 23, 2018).</p><p>Despite that, she is so often the voice of reason — and even maturity. Even when she is speaking to Bam Bam, who is 34 entire years old.</p><p>"I’m just going to be blunt with you," Rain says. "I think you could help more."</p><p>Bam, we learn, has been showing up late and bristles in the face of being given instructions. Again, this is a grown man who was born in 1984.</p><p>"It’s really important for everyone to get involved with this," Rain emphasizes. "Teamwork is important."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Though he had been messing around in the face of Matt’s instructions, Rain’s words do get through to Bam Bam.</p><p>"I’m just me all the time," Bam admits.</p><p>You know what? He sure is.</p><p>He then asks Rain to "just tell me," when he’s not being as helpful as he should. "So maybe I can fix it."</p><p>That sounds like it should be his responsibility rather than Rain’s, but okay.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Rain needs more from Bam Bam than showing up on time and working as a team.</p><p>She admits that what he really brings to the group is a concern with safety. Matt and Gabe, in contrast, are daredevils who take risks like they have something to prove.</p><p>"I think we actually need your help a lot more than we let on," Rain tells Bam.</p><p>She appreciates him agreeing to work on his behavior, and says: "I think that this is a good first step."&nbsp;</p><p>"We still need to get&nbsp;that working on a team level going," Rain says.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>It sounds like Matt — and, honestly, Gabe — need to reign in their impulses, while Bam Bam needs to be more helpful.</p><p>To be fair, they’re all there to film the show. As we know, the Brown family have accumulated their share of wealth over what are now 8 seasons of reality televisions.</p><p>They’re not squatting on land in the wilderness — they’re on <a href=#>Billy Brown’s 435 property</a> in rural Washington.</p><p>Bam isn’t there because he’s a construction expert. He’s there because he’s a reality star and appearing on camera means that he gets paid.</p><p>Still, that injury looks like the real deal. Maybe Matt should wisen up and realize that he’s not as young as he once was. They all need to be careful.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY6voJ2dn6h8orjArKKapl2XwrS0jKmcqKicmnqorcGeZJuqn6y7brLEmqmsZaSdsm7DzquqrWWRm8GmvoymmK2sXZ7AbrXNo2Y%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./yash-dayal.html><span>←</span><span>Yash Dayal- Wiki, Age, Height, Net Worth, Girlfriend, Ethnicity</span></a>
