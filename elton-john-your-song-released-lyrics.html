I was 17 years old and it was coming from someone whose outlook on love or experience with love was totally new and naïve."</span></p><p><span>Bernie wrote the words for this song over breakfast at Elton's parents' house, where he was staying.</span></p><p><span>The original lyrics have coffee stains on them.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000449374985.jpg><h2>Who is Bernie Taupin?</h2><p>Bernie Taupin, 69, is an English lyricist, poet, and singer.</p><p>He is best known for his long-term partnership with Elton, writing the lyrics for most of his songs.</p><p>In 1967, Bernie answered an advert in the New Musical Express by Liberty Records, a company needing new songwriters.</p><p>At the same time, Elton responded to the same advert, and the duo were put together.</p><p>Elton told the man behind the desk that he couldn't write lyrics, so the man handed him a sealed envelope from a pile of lyrics, and it just so happened to contain poems by Bernie.</p><p>Since that day their partnership involves Bernie writing the lyrics before Elton adds the musical melody.</p><p>Elton once said of Bernie: “We lived at my parents’ apartment in North London. He became the brother I never had. I love Bernie, not in a carnal way, but in the most emotional, beautiful way."</p><p>Other than Your Song, the other songs Bernie has written lyrics for include Candle in the Wind, Goodbye Yellow Brick Road and Rocket Man.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">More TV and showbiz</h2></p><h2><b>What are the lyrics for Your Song?</b></h2><p><span>It's a little bit funny, this feeling inside</span></p><p><span>I'm not one of those who can easily hide</span></p><p><span>I don't have much money, but boy if I did</span></p><p><span>I'd buy a big house where we both could live</span></p><p><span>If I was a sculptor, but, but then again, no</span></p><p><span>Or a woman who makes potions on a travelling show</span></p><p><span>I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do</span></p><p><span>My gift is my song, and this one's for you</span></p><p><span>And you can tell everybody this is your song</span></p><p><span>It may be quite simple, but now that it's done</span></p><p><span>I hope you don't mind</span></p><p><span>I hope you don't mind that I put down in words</span></p><p><span>How wonderful life is, now you're in the world</span></p><p><span>I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss</span></p><p><span>Well, a few of the verses, well, they've got me quite cross</span></p><p><span>But the sun's been quite kind while I wrote this song</span></p><p><span>It's for people like you that keep it turned on</span></p><p><span>So excuse me forgetting, but these things I do</span></p><p><span>You see, I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue</span></p><p><span>Anyway, the thing is, what I really mean</span></p><p><span>It's yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen</span></p><p><span>And you can tell everybody this is your song</span></p><p><span>It may be quite simple, but now that it's done</span></p><p><span>I hope you don't mind</span></p><p><span>I hope you don't mind that I put down in words</span></p><p><span>How wonderful life is, now you're in the world</span></p><p><span>I hope you don't mind</span></p><p><span>I hope you don't mind that I put down in words</span></p><p><span>How wonderful life is, now you're in, you're in, you're in, you're in the world</span></p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>John Lewis Christmas advert 2018 - Watch new ad with Elton John singing Your Song in full</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jq2tmqaUqLWww8GisWhvZ2mBc4SUaJylrJ%2Bjequ7x6dksqelp3q0u82gZKudnJqutLHDZqOyqpmYwHA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./trey-brown.html><span>←</span><span>Trey Brown</span></a>
