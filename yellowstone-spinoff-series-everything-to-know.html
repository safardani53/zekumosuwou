Among the spinoffs already released include 1883 and 1923, while two new series have been ordered: a prequel called 1944 and a&nbsp;sequel tentatively called&nbsp;2024.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The latter was&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>previously announced</a>, a sequel series&nbsp;rumored to be a&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Matthew McConaughey</a>-led spinoff.

Lawless lands, bloody gunfights, danger, and dust (lots of it) are promised in each of its nine (and counting) episodes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A star-studded cast was corralled with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Tim McGraw</a> and Faith Hill as leads. They are joined by multi-award winners <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Sam Elliot</a> and Eric Nelsen, in addition to Isabel May, LaMonica Garrett, Audie Rick, Emma Malouff, Dawn Olivieri, Marc Rissmann, Anna Fiamora, James Landry Hébert, Alex Fine, Gratiela Brancusi, Nichole Galicia, Stephanie Nur, Amanda Jaros, Noah Le Gros, and Martin Sensmeier.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Keep a close eye out in the second episode because <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Tom Hanks</a> makes <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>a cameo</a>, playing a general named George Meade in a flashback sequence. 1883 consisted of ten episodes and concluded on Feb. 27, 2022.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The first two episodes premiered in December 2021 on the Paramount Network, but the rest of the series was exclusive to its streamer, Paramount+ (unlike the entirety of Yellowstone which aired on Paramount).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But now, the full season of 1883 will air on Paramount Network beginning June 18 at 8 p.m. ET/PT. The special broadcast will include extended featurettes at the end of each episode.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When ViacomCBS' chief programming officer teased more episodes following its finale, fans speculated whether that meant an extension of season one or if a season 2 was underway. Turns out, neither!</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Instead, the Yellowstone spinoff will be getting an offshoot of its own, titled Lawmen: Bass Reeves.

(It was originally called 1883: The Bass Reeves Story, but received a title change in April.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The upcoming show is described as an anthology series with future installments to follow other iconic lawmen who have impacted history in subsequent seasons, according to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Variety</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The logline for the Bass Reeves season states it will "bring the legendary lawman of the wild west to life. Reeves, known as the greatest frontier hero in American history, worked in the post-Reconstruction era as a federal peace officer in the Indian Territory, capturing over 3,000 of the most dangerous criminals without ever being wounded."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It will star two-time Emmy nominee <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>David Oyelowo</a> in the title role of Bass Reeves. The actor previously voiced his excitement to be a part of the series and work alongside Sheridan in an interview with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Deadline</a>, saying, "The reality is that he is one of the best storytellers on the planet."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He added, "My whole thing is that we've got to tell a story worthy of that history, but worthy of a global audience and he's one of those rare guys, and I've worked with a few of them, and he's one of those rare ones who can really do that. It's a big deal."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Oyelowo will be joined by actor <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Dennis Quaid</a>, who plays Deputy U.S. Marshall Sherrill Lynn in the upcoming spinoff, which is currently in production in his home state.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Riding horses, shooting guns.

They play husband and wife, matriarch Cara Dutton and patriarch Jacob Dutton, respectively.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The series chronologically follows the events that unfolded in 1883 (hence its title) — which saw the Duttons make their dangerous trek to Montana. It follows the couple, along with their children, as they run the family farm in the aforementioned state while navigating the challenges of the early 20th century, which include pandemics, a historic drought, the end of Prohibition and the Great Depression.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-59 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The teaser — which dropped during the season 5 premiere of Yellowstone in November 2022 — <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>gave a glimpse into the chaos of the time</a>, showing multiple battles both on the ground and on horseback. The central characters get in on the action, with a shot of Mirren's Cara, injured and pointing a rifle at someone, and Ford's Jacob looking desperately to the side as he points a gun off camera.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-61 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ford told reporters in December that the formation of the project <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>is what ultimately got him hooked</a> on the role. "The writing and the ambition of the piece that's evident from the scope and scale of it, [drew me to the role,]" he explained. "And the precision of his language and dialogue, and the character."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-63 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The series, which also stars Marley Shelton, Jennifer Ehle, Sebastian Roché and Darren Mann, was <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>confirmed for a second season</a>, which will include eight episodes, Deadline reported. 1923 is available to stream exclusively on Paramount+.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-6666></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-67 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>6666</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-68 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Emerson Miller/Paramount+</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-69 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Pronounced "Four Sixes," 6666 details the raw and authentic perspective of a real cattle ranch — this time in West Texas, rather than Montana like depicted in Yellowstone.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-71 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The Sixes is one of the oldest ranches in Texas, one of the oldest ranches in the country...
