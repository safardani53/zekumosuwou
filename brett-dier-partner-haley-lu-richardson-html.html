Everything was spontaneous since the Five Feet Apart actress did not know she would propose to her partner.</p><p>She said it was a "totally in the moment" thing, and she followed her gut feeling. They were at an outside strip mall at the moment, eating pizza. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>All of a sudden, Richardson wanted to ask Dier to marry her, and she did so.
