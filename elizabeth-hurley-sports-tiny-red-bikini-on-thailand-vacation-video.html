While the actress, 58, was sad to bring her vacation to an end, she clearly had a blast during her getaway, and made the most of the resort’s pool. “Parting is such sweet sorrow, glorious Chiva Som. we’ll be back,” she wrote along with a heart emoji in the caption.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>The montage was set to&nbsp;<strong>Françoise Hardy’s&nbsp;</strong>“Le temps de l’amour,” and Elizabeth looked like she was loving the resort’s pool. She included clips of her floating, flashing a smile as she approached the edge of the pool, climbing out of the pool, walking up the steps, and showing off her swimming abilities, all while wearing a tiny, sexy red bikini.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>While it’s not clear what exact bikini Elizabeth appears to be wearing, she does have plenty of styles available on her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>website</a>, and they range from $168 to $196. They come in a variety of colors (and even a cheetah-print style), and they all look absolutely stunning.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Elizabeth revealed that she’d gone to the Chiva-Som Hua Hin health spa back on November 16. She’s shared quite a few <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>clips</a> from her different activities during the getaway. She’s shared <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>clips</a> of herself floating in a large tub and <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>getting steamed</a> on her Instagram. “Greetings from Thailand and from one of my favourite health spas in the world: Chiva-Som Hua Hin,” she wrote earlier in November. “I first came to Chiva Som in the late 90’s and it has become even more serene and beautiful. I have been exercising, eating extremely healthily and attempting to become more mindful.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/elizabeth-hurley-red-bikini-video-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-8>The&nbsp;Bedazzled&nbsp;star has never shied away from showing off her many beautiful bathing suits, especially since she’s been releasing beachwear every summer since 2005. Back in October, she posted a throwback from a late summer getaway as she <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>rocked a yellow bikini</a>. She also wrote about how different it was to now be “huddled in front of the fire in a fleece onesie.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH5ye5FwZp6kma%2Buo7HToWShraKhsrp50qmmq6yjYsGquthmqZ6cXZe2rLXNomSopl2ptaK1y5qlnWWmlrCiwMiopWaumZmysHs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./caravan-carolyns-boyfriend-list.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Caravan Carolyn Dating Caravan Carolyn's Boyfriend &amp;amp; Exes</span></a>
