Still, “the party doesn’t stop” after the day is over, Shepherd declared as she went out for a night on the town in New York City.</p><p>In February, the Daytime Emmy nominee expressed her excitement when <a href=#>her eponymous show</a> was announced.</p><p>“OMG! I am so excited to have my dream come true and debut my very own talk show Sherri in the fall,” she shared at the time. “I can’t wait until I return to [New York] to host the show and merge everything I love … pop culture, talk, entertainment and comedy.”</p><p>In addition to her thriving career as a talk show host, Shepherd is also mom of sons Jeffrey Jr., 16, and Lamar Jr., 8, whom she shares with ex-husbands <strong>Jeffrey Tarpley</strong> and <strong>Lamar Sally</strong>, respectively. In the summer, no matter how busy her days might get, the Chicago native loves her nightly routine unwinding with her family.</p><p>“I love <a href=#>summer nights</a> — the sun is out when I get home,” she tells Us, explaining that she uses her time after work to walk her dog, Lexi, and make “dinner on the grill for me and my son.”</p><p>The 30 Rock alum also ensures she has time to relax with pals — including <a href=#>her best friend</a>, comedian <strong>Kym Whitley</strong>. “She knows how much I love to roller skate,” Shepherd gushes to Us. “So she turned her tennis court into a roller rink.”</p><p>With the Monday, September 12, premiere of Sherri just around the corner, the actress is ready for her dream of having her own TV show to be realized.</p><p>“It’s something that I used to dream about when I was a little girl. I would line up my teddy bears with my Barbie dolls … and I would put them on chairs,” Shepherd told <a href=#>Variety </a>in an interview published on Thursday, September 9.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>She is also ready to join the ranks of other iconic Black hosts. “It is so important that people see a representation of themselves,” Shepherd continued, noting, “I didn’t get to see a lot of Black women on TV growing up.”</p><p>Keep scrolling to see a typical day in the life of Shepherd:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkwKa7jKyfnqqinnq0tMSpn56qlGKubrDAsmSipl2ixm64yJ%2BcaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./michael-k-young.html><span>←</span><span>Michael K.
