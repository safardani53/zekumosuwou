The announcement, which was shared on social media by Branco Wine Company, indicated that Franzia died on Tuesday morning at his home, with the cause of death unclear. According to the declaration,</p><p>“At the heart of his vision was the conviction that wine should be savored and drank at every American table.” When asked how Branco Wine Company could offer wine for less than a barrel of water, Fred T. Franzia famously said, “They’re overcharging for the water – don’t you understand it?”</p><p>Bronco Wine Company “has achieved vertical integration,” according to the statement, and “his entrepreneurial energy, relentless effort, and passion for his family and the Bronco family will be remembered forever.”&nbsp;Fred Franzia’s five children, 14 grandkids, one brother, and two sisters survive him.</p><h2>Fred Franzia’s net worth</h2><p>Fred Franzia rose to prominence as the CEO and co-founder of Charles Shaw, better known as Two Buck Chuck, one of the largest wineries in the United States. Two Buck Chuck is one of the fastest-growing wine firms in history, having sold over 5 million cases and over 60 million bottles for total yearly revenue of $100 million. Although the exact sum is unclear, different sources estimate Franzia’s net worth to be more than $25 million. He made a lot of money through his employment in the wine sector.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Fred-Franzia-2.jpg alt="Fred Franzia " width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>All About Fred Franzia</h2><p>He was born into one of California’s most prominent wine families and began working in the family wine company after graduation. In December 1973, he founded Bronco Wine Co., which now controls around 50,000 acres of vineyards in California’s Central Valley. Every year, the firm produces around 61 million gallons, resulting in yearly sales of 20 million cases of 240 million bottles.&nbsp;However, in 1993, Fred Franzia and Bronco were charged with conspiracy for misrepresenting inexpensive grapes for $100 to $200 per ton. Bronco and Franzia pled not guilty and were fined $2.5 million and $500,000, respectively.</p><p>Despite the fact that Franzia joined the wine market to make money, he opted to keep things inexpensive for everyone. Bronco cultivates vineyards, crushes grapes, bottles wine, and manages its distribution business. It also inspects the storage and production facilities in five Central Valley and Napa Valley municipalities, as well as the labels Charles Shaw, Crane Lake, Forest Glen, and Forestville.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Fred-Franzia.jpg alt="Fred Franzia " width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>In 1995, Fred Franzia purchased the Charles Shaw label from a Napa Valley vineyard and has since sold about 800 million bottles of wine in 12 years. The Franzias presently hold between 35,000 and 55,000 acres of vineyards and five wineries. Bronco Wine Company is currently one of the country’s fifth-largest wineries, with labels such as Allure, Blanc De Bleu, Crane Lake, Gravel Bar, Six Degrees, and others.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGidq52UYrOzrc2zoJplkWLBuLuMm6yco12YtbavymauoqaVYrCzscCtpqtloJbAtLHDZpiwmalirrV506GcZpmXmnqwsoxwcGg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mariz-actress.html><span>←</span><span>Fame | Mariz (actress) net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</span></a>
