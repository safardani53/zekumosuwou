<span>Larita Shotwell</span></p><h1>Paul O Grady Passed Away At The Age Of 67</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>Paul O Grady</strong>, a presenter and comic, died suddenly at the age of 67. His spouse, Andre Portasio, verified his death in a statement, saying that O’Grady passed “unexpectedly but peacefully.” According to the statement:</p><p>“It is with deep regret that I inform you that Paul died suddenly but peacefully yesterday evening.”</p><p>Portasio also praised O’Grady’s fans and allies on his late husband’s behalf:</p><p>“He will be sorely missed by his loved ones, friends, family, animals, and everyone who appreciated his wit, humour, and compassion.” I’m sure he’d want me to praise you for all of the affection you’ve shown him over the years.”</p><p>O’Grady and Portasio allegedly married in a low-key affair in 2017. The comic was on tour as Miss Hannigan in the show Annie at the time of his passing.&nbsp;Paul O Grady shared on Instagram a few weeks ago that he was “thoroughly enjoying” reprising the part after such a long time, “especially with such a truly amazing and lovely cast.”</p><p></p><p>Paul O Grady resigned his position as a Radio 2 presenter in August 2022, citing dissatisfaction with sharing his Sunday afternoon spot. However, he was scheduled to appear on Boom Radio on Easter Sunday.&nbsp;O’Grady’s most recent television performance was with Queen Consort Camilla in a one-off segment of For the Love of Dogs in 2022. According to reports, the comic helped start the series in 2012 alongside employees from Battersea Dogs and Cats Home, where he worked as an advocate.</p><h2>A look into Paul O Grady’s health problems</h2><p>Paul O Grady, a comedian, died “unexpectedly but peacefully” lately. While his passing was sadly unexpected, the media figure had previously voiced health worries.&nbsp;During his life, O Grady experienced two heart assaults and fought an extremely tough fight with COVID-19. The broadcaster told Mirror UK that he caught the virus in Malta and was unable to work for two months due to the disease’s “wheezing.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Paul-O-Grady-1.jpg alt="Paul O Grady" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The comic requested that his doctor conduct the necessary procedures. Following an X-ray, he was identified with “recovering COVID.” The findings made O’Grady worry that he would never heal, and things worsened when he was compelled to take time off work due to lingering symptoms.&nbsp;The narrator became “really ill” after shooting the second series of Sally Lindsay’s The Madame Blanc Mysteries in Malta:</p><p>“I was able to avoid COVID until last year, when I became infected.” I didn’t get it at all because I was sick. It completely exhausted me. I was astounded by how awful I was. It took me about two months to recover. “I had lost my breath.”</p><p>Paul O Grady allegedly spent the summer recuperating from health problems at his estate in Kent:</p><p>“I’d go out to feed the pigs and have to stop twice or three times on the way there, wheezing.” I did nothing but slumber. I’d wake up, go downstairs, rest on the sofa, and then fall asleep for four hours.”</p><p>The comic went on to expand on his act, saying he “felt terrible” about his health:</p><p>“I’d get out of bed, have a cup of tea, then go back to bed and sleep all night; it was strange.”I just felt awful about it. I’ve never had so much sleep in my life. I’d had all the shots, but it was the final nail in the coffin.”</p><p>O Grady also remembered feeling like he was “dying” after experiencing the early symptoms:</p><p>“We finished one day of filming, and that night I felt a little off, and the next day I felt like I was dying.” I was suffering from a severe pain and a dreadful wheeze. I stayed nine days in a dormitory room, gently rounding the corner.”</p><p>He claimed that he felt better after traveling back home, but that he became ill again after a few days:</p><p>“I eventually flew back home and felt a lot better, but then I felt shocking and I was in bed again, I just couldn’t shake it off.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Paul-O-Grady-2.jpg alt="Paul O Grady" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>The 67-year-old expressed gratitude that the fight ended after two months, but revealed that his experience was not pleasant:</p><p>“Thank God I’m over it now, but there was a time when I wondered, ‘Is this ever going to go away?'” ‘Will I ever regain my vitality and cease being tired?’ It wasn’t a nice experience.”</p><p>Paul O Grady’s untimely death devastated his family, friends, coworkers, business partners, and fans. At the time of writing, the direct reason of his demise had not been made public.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGinmq2cYrxus9Gam7JloJbAtLHDZpiwmalirrV506GcZpmXmnqwsoxvbmg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kim-kardashian-bikini-sports-illustrated-photoshoot-dominican-republic-video.html><span>←</span><span>Kim Kardashians Wows In Bikini During Sports Illustrated Photoshoot Hollywood Life</span></a>
