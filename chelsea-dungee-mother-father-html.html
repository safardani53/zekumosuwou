The Dallas Wings of the WNBA made her their <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">first-round pick</a> in the 2021 WNBA Draft. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>This success came after a lot of hard work and dedication throughout her college career. But she wasn’t the only one who put in a lot of work. Her mother was right there with her through it all.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>Making Mom Proud</h2><p>Chelsea cannot recall a time when she didn’t want to play basketball and make it to the league. The <a href=# rel=follow>WNBA</a> is entering its 25th season now, and she is 24 — in a way, the two grew up together and were meant for one another. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Growing up in Okmulgee, Oklahoma, and learning to play in the dirt, she showed great potential right from the get-go. She caught the eyes of journalists from as early as 14.</p><p>The praise and publicity meant that her mother, Chi Dungee, had her work cut out. And she dealt with the pressure of raising a potential superstar well.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Chi, a single parent and social worker,&nbsp;sacrificed a lot for Chelsea. "She made a lot of sacrifices. She gave up her dreams so that I could live out mine. Taking off work to come to games, having to do sponsors all the time to help me," she <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">told People</a>. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Chi gave up things so she could help Chelsea grow. She did it all — took her to games, to the gym, even worked out, ran, and conditioned with her.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>But Chi never saw it that way. Whenever Chelsea says thank you, she responds by saying she did all that because she wanted to and that they weren’t sacrifices.</p><p>During her high school and college years, Chi never missed Chelsea’s home games. And that tradition is likely to continue now that she’s in the big leagues. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>The Wings drafting her means she’s very close to Chi, who still lives in Oklahoma. “I’m only about three-and-a-half hours from her and about five from Arkansas, so it couldn’t be a better situation,” said Chelsea to the New York Times.</p><h2>Difficult Upbringing</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Chelsea had a difficult childhood. Her mother and father did a lot for her, and she loves her parents, but there were many constraints growing up. For example, social&nbsp;work didn’t make a lot of money. And usually, the mother-daughter duo had little to spend on food every night.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>They endured all of that, and&nbsp;Chelsea started to make a name for herself early. She started collecting trophies from her spectacular high school career. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>But, when she was in her sophomore year in high school, their house burned down. And with that, her trophies, clothes, and furniture as well.</p><p>Chelsea and Chi lived in a hotel for a while. They didn’t have the means to rebuild their&nbsp;house — they decided to rent a house after a few months.</p><p>The fire seemingly ignited a flame inside Chelsea. She came out of that difficult situation with her mother’s support and a will to make it in the sport she loved playing.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>After that, her career only saw growth. Chelsea finished her college career at the University of Arkansas with flying colors. And now, she’s on her way to write her name in&nbsp;history's pages, starting at the Dallas Wings.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJuYmrm0scBmm66ml5qybrnOrZ%2Beql2brrW0xKtloaydoQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./brandon-ingram.html><span>←</span><span>Brandon Ingram- Wiki, Age, Height, Net Worth, Girlfriend, Ethnicity</span></a>
