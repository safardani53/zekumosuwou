Fresh off his four-month tour of duty in Afghanistan, <a href=#><strong>Prince Harry</strong></a> enjoyed a night out with a relative and reality stars in London Friday, Feb. 15, <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> can exclusively report.</p><p>Joined by his cousin, <strong>Princess Beatrice</strong>, and Made in Chelsea reality stars <strong>Hugo Taylor</strong> and <strong>Spencer Matthews</strong>, the 28-year-old was spotted dancing at Bodos Schloss, a new ski chalet-style restaurant, bar and dance club owned by his close friend,<strong> Thomas Van Straubenzee</strong>. Harry reportedly bought a round of shots for the bar.</p><p>"Harry was having a great time drinking with his friends," a club source tells <strong>Us</strong>. "He had a good ol' flirt with some cute girls, including <strong>Ashley Roberts</strong> from Pussycat Dolls, but it was just banter and he spent most the night with his friends, and Bea, in the VIP area."</p><p><a href=#><strong>Prince William</strong></a>'s younger brother took a regular black cab home, shunning his usual chauffeur driven Range Rover. Ever a gentleman, Harry wrote notes for the taxi driver's daughter and her friend, which they then posted on Twitter. "Dear Mickie, your dad loves you . . . teach him to drive properly!" he told an English teen named <strong>Mickie Jayne</strong>. He also wished a her friend, <strong>Callie Connelly</strong>, a "happy b-day."</p><p>Harry — who made headlines for his <a href=#>nude romp</a> in Las Vegas just one month before his September 2012 deployment — partied for 15 hours straight immediately after returning home from Afghanistan in late January.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The redheaded royal was spotted at a pub in Fulham, West London, on the afternoon of Jan. 26, where he stayed until around 9 p.m. After a brief pit-stop at a local Sainsbury supermarket, the prince continued his night at a friend's house party and didn't exit until the early hours of the following morning.</p><p>Unlike his brother and his pregnant sister-in-law, <a href=#><strong>Kate Middleton</strong></a>, Harry is in no rush to settle down. "If you find the right person and everything feels right, then it takes time — especially for myself and my brother," he told the British press last month.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGapqpmjsKZ5x5qpq7Fdm7mqvtOsZLChpJ16scHSrLCcmaRisbC4y6xkmquYobK6edGomZ6qpKh6sa3RraCeq12strW0jKmpoqaTmsC0ecGemK2qmZiybq3NnWSmmZSaeqq6jJyfnqSjmq5ur8Csq2ZqYGaAcoKRaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jimmy-johns-summer-wraps-caesar-thai-spicy-jalapeno.html><span>←</span><span>Popular sandwich chain and Subway rival launches new summer menu and brings back fan favorite</span></a>
