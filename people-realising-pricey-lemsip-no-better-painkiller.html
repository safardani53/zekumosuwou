Many have been hit by cold and flu symptoms this winter, with some taking to social media to complain about their 'super cold'.
In order to ease their symptoms, they've been flocking to supermarkets and pharmacies to pick up remedies that might help.
One common cold and flu treatment is Lemsip.
They come in sachets in different flavours, which you then mix with hot water."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

I swear by it. So it’s all placebo?"</p><p>Another user added: "I'm convinced it makes me feel better."</p><p>"I find cold remedies really make a difference to my stuffy nose and allow me to sleep/get through the day - but I'd be hard-pressed to tell you which drug is the one that works best," another added.</p><p>One said that it was the 'food of the gods' and that they wouldn't be without it'.</p><p>However, some already said they were aware the product doesn't work: "I just use paracetamol and hot Vimto and buy a nasal spray decongestant."</p><p>Another said that their go to remedy is hot Ribena with ibuprofen.</p><p>They claimed: "It's basically what Lemsip is - hot drink with painkillers - and Lemsip is a total f**** scam."</p><p>In <a href=#>Boots</a> ten sachets of Lemsip sachets will set you back £4.50.</p><p>However, paracetamol costs just 49p for the pharmacy's own brand, with ibuprofen costing 55p.</p><p>Scott added that though the individual active ingredients are the same between branded and generic versions.</p><p>"Often companies will produce proprietary combinations – whereby a single generic version does not exist and you will need to take several different generic tablets to make an equivalent formulation," he said.</p><p>He added: "Some cold and flu medicines are also formulated as liquids and have a noticeable taste associated with them.</p><p>"As the non-active ingredients may differ, some patients may prefer the taste of a branded version, and if an unpleasant taste results in patients not taking the recommended dosage the effect will not be optimal."</p><p>It comes after it was revealed that there is a <a href=#>shortage of Lemsip</a> across the UK.</p><p>Demand for the products is said to be “much higher than in years gone by” as Britain grapples with&nbsp;<a href=#>flu</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>Covid</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=#>winter colds</a>.</p><h2>MONEY SAVING</h2><p>One GP previously said that there is a <a href=#>money-saving hack</a> that could help cut your bill when it comes to the pharmacy.</p><p><a href=#>Dr Karan Rajan</a>&nbsp;said whenever you purchase medication, you should make sure you look for the PL number.</p><p>This is the product licence number, which is a unique number of the package which helps identify it.</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Posting online</a>, he explained: "If you spot two different packets with the same PL number even if the packaging if completely different and one is branded and one is non-branded, the active ingredient, the formulation and the product is exactly the same.</p><p>"When a company develops a drug, it's given unique rights to sell it for a number of years, but once that term ends, any company can make it."</p><p>This means that the exact same ingredients are in medications that can sometimes cost double the price for the branded version.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>In a statement, Reckitt, the manufacturers of Lemsip said:<br>"Consumer pricing is at the sole discretion of the retailer.
