But if you ask me, his looks are classic — like a Renaissance painting — and his chiselled physique could be carved from stone.</p><p>Referring to the Statue of David, one fan on X, formerly <a href=#>Twitter</a>, wrote: “RIP Michelangelo, you would have loved Jeremy Allen White.”</p><p>But it’s not just the actor’s toned stomach and sculpted biceps that make him so hot.</p><p>A big part of his sexiness is down to his role in the award-winning Disney+ show — his character’s passion, perfectionism and dedication when it comes to satisfying his customers with nothing but the best cuisine.</p><p>Food is inherently sensual: It’s obvious how a man who pays obsessively close attention to taste, texture, scent and experimentation in the kitchen might deliver comparable levels of sensuous pleasure in the bedroom.</p><p>Carmy may serve his steaks rare, but between the sheets you know you’d be well done.</p><p>And dad-of-two Jeremy, who is separated from his wife, actress Addison Timlin, embodies the perfectionism of his character, even studying at the Institute of Culinary Education to prepare for the role.</p><p>Carmy has all the key “T” ingredients, too: He’s tattooed, tousled, talented and troubled.</p><p>A bad boy with plenty of good in him; a bit of rough whose life you want to help smooth.</p><p>Jeremy’s next role is as wrestler Kerry Von Erich in movie <a href=#>The Iron Claw.</a></p><p>Apparently, filming it helped him prepare for the Calvin Klein shoot, since it features a lot of scenes of him wearing tiny shorts.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Great news for people like me — and his rumoured girlfriend the Spanish pop star Rosalia (yes, sorry to break it to you).</p><p>For us, any time that Jeremy Allen White is in briefs is all too brief indeed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/modelling-calvin-klein-325406.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1996-athletic-modern-cotton-performance-869902852.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/footballer-freddie-ljungberg-calvin-klein-3358567.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/calvin-klein-rolls-global-justin-141970833.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/jamie-doran-christian-grey-50-49024215.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jq2tmqaUqLWww8GisWhqZWeDdoGTbGajnaKaurp5wKWjnqZdrLWqwMRmmpqkpp67brfLnqCnZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./romane-recaldes-boyfriend-list.html><span>←</span><span>Romane Recaldes Boyfriend: Who is Romane Recalde Dating?</span></a>
