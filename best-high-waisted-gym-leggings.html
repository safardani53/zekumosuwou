They're ideal for trips to the supermarket, school runs and coffee dates too.&nbsp;</p><p>In need of some inspo? Read on for our tried and tested selection of the best high-waisted gym leggings available to buy right now.</p><h2>Best high-waisted gym leggings at a glance:</h2><h2>Fabletics Define PowerHold High-Waisted 7/8 Legging</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Untitled-design-11-2.png><p><strong>Pros: </strong>33 different colour options, high compression, very flattering, sweat-wicking, chafe-resistant, UPF protection, pockets&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Unlike the other Fabletics leggings, these don't come in regular, short and tall</p><p><strong>Rating:</strong> 5/5</p><p>I never thought I'd say this, but I love these white leggings. When you think of light-coloured leggings, you automatically think they're going to be garish, see-through, and unflattering. However, these were actually one of my favourites to wear. And, if you really don't want a pair of white leggings, they come in an impressive 33 different shades.&nbsp;</p><p>These leggings feel as if they're doing a lot of hard work, and that's because they are. Fabletics' PowerHold fabric is designed with the highest compression possible to hold you in without restricting your range of movement.&nbsp;</p><p>The cut of these leggings is perfect. The 7/8 length is great if you like to wear tube socks with your trainers, and the high-rise waist falls exactly where we like it to — just above the smallest part of your waist, but not so high that you look like Mickey Mouse.</p><p><strong>Leg length:</strong> 7/8; <strong>Size range:</strong> XXS to 4X; <strong>Colours available:</strong> 33 colours; <strong>Fabric:</strong> Polyester and elastane</p><h2><strong>BAM Enduro Bamboo Deep Waistband Leggings&nbsp;</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Untitled-design-15.png><ul><li><strong>BAM Enduro Bamboo Deep Waistband Leggings, £49 from BAM - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p><strong>Pros:&nbsp;</strong>Flattering, sustainable, range of colours available, don't fall down, thick waistband, discrete logo&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Tricky to get on</p><p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4/5</p><p>BAM's Enduro leggings are made from a mix of sustainable bamboo, viscose, cotton and elastane. The result? A pair of eco-friendly leggings that are incredibly sculpting and supportive — particularly around the waist, thanks to the thick, long waistband that doesn't roll down.&nbsp;</p><p>I felt very secure in these leggings and found them to be very flattering.&nbsp;</p><p>I love the simple black colour – also available in five other bold colours and prints – and discrete logo, and would wear these for the gym or running errands.&nbsp;</p><p>The only issue I had (which shoppers in the site's review section agreed with) was that they're a little tricky to get on. Initially, I thought they weren't going to fit, but was pleasantly surprised when I wiggled into them and found they fit perfectly. You want them to be this figure-hugging to make sure they don't fall down during an arduous workout and to emphasise your curves.&nbsp;</p><p>I was also pleased that, even though these were tight, there was no VPL. So, whether you're wearing your biggest knickers or a seamless thong, nobody will know.</p><p><strong>Leg length:</strong> Full; <strong>Size range:</strong> 8-18; <strong>Colours available:</strong> 14 colours; <strong>Fabric:</strong> Bamboo, viscose, organic cotton and elastane&nbsp;</p><h2>Acai Outdoor Softshell Leggings&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Untitled-design-32.png><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Waterproof<strong>, </strong>flattering, drawstring waist to ensure perfect fit, handy zip pocket, comfortable, stretchy</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> None&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Rating:</strong> 5/5</p><p>When you live in the rainy UK, it's important to own clothing that will protect you from the elements. After all, we only experience a couple of months of true summer weather every year.&nbsp; This doesn't have to mean going out in macs and traditional waterproof clothing, though. These leggings from Acai are shower-resistant, meaning they repel liquid and dry extremely quickly.</p><p>Sadly, since it was the height of summer at the time of reviewing these, I didn't get the chance to try these leggings out in the rain. But, I love how they fit and can see how the lightweight and breathable softshell fabric is perfect for hot, cold and rainy days.&nbsp;</p><p>They're really stretchy, so your movement won't be restricted, and the fabric is snag-proof, so they're suitable for outdoor activities like trail running, hiking, cycling and so on.&nbsp;</p><p>To maintain the leggings' waterproof properties, use Grangers Wash + Repel Liquid every three to five washes.</p><p><strong>Leg length:</strong> Full; <strong>Size range:</strong> 6-18; <strong>Colours available:</strong> 4 colours (black, green, navy and aubergine); <strong>Fabric:</strong> Nylon and Elastane&nbsp;</p><h2>BAM Flexa Seamless Running Leggings</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Untitled-design-34.png><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Flattering, super soft, stretchy, comfortable, sustainable</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Only available in one colour&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Rating:</strong> 5/5</p><p>BAM's Flexa Seamless Running Leggings reminded me of the woolly tights I used to wear to school – in the best way.</p><p>They're ribbed and incredibly cosy and soft. And, even though they do sculpt your legs, tummy and bum every so slightly, I wouldn't describe them as tight or clingy.&nbsp;</p><p>At first, I didn't think I'd like the pattern but as soon as I got the leggings on, I realised that the lines trick the eye and make you look slimmer. I'd wear these to the gym, on a walk, or even just relaxing around the house.</p><p><strong>Leg length:</strong> Full; <strong>Size range:</strong> S-L; <strong>Colours available:</strong> 1; <strong>Fabric:</strong> Bamboo Viscose, Amni Soul Eco Polyamide, and Elastane&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>Free People High-Rise 7/8 Length Good Karma Leggings&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Untitled-design-26-copy.png><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Flattering, super soft, stretchy ribbed fabric, comfortable, come in a variety of colours</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Expensive&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><strong>Rating:</strong> 5/5</p><p>If you're bored of plain black leggings, Free People's Good Karma Leggings come in 17 different shades. I chose this bright Red Apple shade, and I'm so pleased I did because it'll stand out against my collection of neutral gym trainers and tops.&nbsp;</p><p>The leggings themselves are incredibly flattering, made of a ribbed knit fabric that holds in your waist and shapes your tummy, legs and bum – without looking or feeling like you're wearing typical heavy-duty shaping leggings.</p><p>They're so comfortable that I wear them when I'm working from home.&nbsp;</p><p>These are great for working out and fashion purposes, and I've got a lot of wear out of mine so far (and will be purchasing them in multiple colours, from black to Barbiecore pink).</p><p>They also have SPF30 UV Protection, making them ideal for outdoor fitness sessions or just wearing them out and about.&nbsp;</p><p>They may be a little pricey at £78, but since they're so high quality and versatile, they're well worth the splurge.</p><p><strong>Leg length:</strong> 7/8;&nbsp;<strong>Size range:</strong> XS-XL; <strong>Colours available:</strong> 17; <strong>Fabric:</strong> Spandex and Nylon</p><h2>SEFI Timeless Leggings 7/8&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Untitled-design-10.png><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Sculpting fabric is very flattering, ultra high-waisted, supportive, soft, stretchy, breathable, sweat-wicking, contouring detail on back, no VPL&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong>&nbsp;Only available in 3 colours&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Rating:</strong> 5/5</p><p>I've owned this pair of leggings for around nine months, and they've become a wardrobe staple. To me, they're the legging equivalent of my favourite Levi Ribcage jeans — that's how high-waisted they are.</p><p>These have the highest waistband of all the leggings I tried, so they almost feel like you're wearing shape-wear and leggings in one (which is ideal for the days when you're particularly bloated).&nbsp;</p><p>They support your legs, bums and tummy nicely without feeling too tight and restrictive&nbsp; – unlike a lot of seamless and sculpting gym leggings on the market.&nbsp;</p><p>The soft and stretchy fabric is breathable and I find that it feels cool and dry on the skin, no matter how sweaty I get during a workout.&nbsp;</p><p>These are the leggings I reach for when I'm WFH or popping to the post office, as well as when I'm heading to a gym class.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Leg length:</strong> 7/8; <strong>Size range: </strong>XXS to XL; <strong>Colours available:</strong> 3 colours; <strong>Fabric:</strong> Polyamide and elastane</p><h2>BAM Mallea Yoga Leggings Full Length&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Untitled-design-26.png><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Stretchy fabric designed for yoga,&nbsp; supportive, soft, breathable, no outside seam, no digging</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> None</p><p><strong>Rating:</strong> 5/5</p><p>Here at The Sun, we love BAM. The brand is the perfect choice if you're trying to be sustainable but don't want to skimp on quality, functionality and style.</p><p>These Mallea Yoga Leggings feel like regular fashion leggings on the skin. They're made from modal bamboo fabric, so they're soft, lightweight and have a weightless, barely-there feel.&nbsp;</p><p>But, that doesn't mean they're unsupportive. They still sculpt the body slightly and protect against chafing without making you feel constricted.</p><p>These leggings are finer, lighter and more breathable than regular gym leggings, but that's because they're developed with yoga in mind. You don't want anything that restricts your movement or breathing when you're on the mat, that's for sure.&nbsp;</p><p>Available in a range of colours and patterns both 7/8 length and full length, there's an option for every yogi.</p><p><strong>Leg length:</strong> 7/8; <strong>Size range: </strong>8 to 16; <strong>Colours available: 5</strong>; <strong>Fabric:</strong> Mallea modal fabric&nbsp;</p><h2>SEFI Define Cross Over Leggings&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Untitled-design-27.png><ul><li><strong>SEFI Define Cross Over Leggings, £62 from SEFI - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Impressive size range, super soft fabric, flattering V waistband, sculpting, lightweight, moisture-wicking and squat-proof</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Only available in 2 shades</p><p><strong>Rating:</strong> 5/5</p><p>SEFI's new Define Cross Over Leggings have my heart. The unique waistband is not only really pretty, but I found that it enhanced my curves.</p><p>The differently-shaped waistband doesn't take away any sculpting power, either. These leggings hold your tummy in without being too tight – and they do the same to the legs and bum.&nbsp;</p><p>The fabric is silky smooth and exactly what you want to wear for maximum comfort, whether you're going to the gym or just hanging out at home.</p><p>Plus, it's lightweight, moisture-wicking, and squat-proof, so you won't have any embarrassing sweat patches or ripping accidents when you're going hard during a workout.</p><p><strong>Leg length:</strong> Full; <strong>Size range:</strong> XXS to XL; <strong>Colours available:</strong> 2 colours; <strong>Fabric:</strong> Nylon and Spandex</p><h2>Myprotein MP Women's Shape Seamless Leggings</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Untitled-design-11-copy.png><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Sculpting, flattering, comes in XXS to XXL, available in 12 different colours, seamless&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Cons:&nbsp;</strong>Waistband rolls down, tricky to get on&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Rating:</strong> 3/5</p><p>If you're looking for a solid pair of seamless black leggings for less than £50, go for these from Myprotein.&nbsp;</p><p>Admittedly, I had a struggle getting them on and found that the waistband does roll down a little when you bend over. However, these leggings are very flattering and do have sculpting powers.&nbsp;</p><p>They're a little more low-waisted than the other options on this list, but still cover the main portion of the stomach and hold you in.</p><p>I'll be wearing these on my daily walks, for sure.</p><p><strong>Leg length:</strong> Full; <strong>Size range:</strong> XXS to XXL; <strong>Colours available:</strong> 12 colours; <strong>Fabric:</strong> Nylon and elastane&nbsp;</p><h2>TALA DayFlex High Waisted Legging&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Untitled-design-12-2.png><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Available in 2xs to XL, available in full length and 7/8, available in six stylish muted shades, very, very easy to put on, waistband doesn't slip, supportive on tummy, comfortable, sweetheart contouring, sustainable (made from 75% recycled nylon)&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> None</p><p><strong>Rating:</strong> 5/5</p><p>TALA's DayFlex leggings are flawless. They are silky smooth and you won't have a struggle slipping into them.</p><p>In fact, I was amazed at how easy these were to put on. The product description says these give a 'naked feel that glides on', and that's not an exaggeration.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The waistband is the ideal tightness and width for holding in your tummy without digging into the skin, and the V seam or sweetheart contouring on the back is very flattering on the bum.&nbsp;</p><p>These will be my go-to for day-to-day life, styled with an oversized slogan sweatshirt and dad trainers. And, I'll be wearing them for all kinds of workouts — from yoga to boxing.&nbsp;</p><p>If you're not into a full-length leg, these are also available in 7/8 length.</p><p><strong>Leg length:</strong> Full or 7/8; <strong>Size range:</strong> 2XS to XL; <strong>Colours available:</strong> 6 colours; <strong>Fabric:</strong> Recycled nylon and lycra</p><h2>TALA SkinLuxe High Waisted Flared Legging&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Untitled-design-13-1.png><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Flattering flared leg, waist band doesn't fall down, super soft, easy to put on, comfortable, back pocket with zip, lightweight, sustainable (made from recycled nylon)&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Cons:&nbsp;</strong>Only available in 4 colours&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Rating:</strong> 5/5</p><p>TALA's SkinLuxe flared leggings are the trendiest pair of gym leggings I've ever owned.</p><p>If, like me, you prefer flared trousers in your day-to-day life, you'll love these. They're super high-waisted and sculpting, and I find that they really accentuate curves without hugging your body too tightly.</p><p>The flared leg is very flattering on your legs, too.</p><p>I wear this pair when WFH – and, with a pair of chunky trainers, they're great for running errands and hanging out with friends in comfort and style.&nbsp;</p><p>They're also perfect for gym sessions on days when you feel extra bloated or don't want to rock something skin-tight. The high waist does not budge and will stay put, even if you're hunched over and moving rapidly during a spin class.</p><p><strong>Leg length:</strong> Full; <strong>Size range:</strong> XS to XL; <strong>Colours available:</strong> 4 colours; <strong>Fabric:</strong> Recycled nylon and lycra&nbsp;</p><h2>lululemon Align™ High-Rise Pant</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Untitled-design-11-3.png><p><strong>Pros:&nbsp;</strong>Lightweight and breathable, waistband doesn't dig, but also stays put, super soft, easy to put on, comfortable, form-fitting and flattering, available in sizes UK 4 to 24, available in 18 colours&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Will show VPL, if you're wearing the wrong knickers</p><p><strong>Rating:</strong> 5/5</p><p>lululemon has a reputation for producing high-quality, luxury activewear, and these leggings did not disappoint.</p><p>They're silky smooth (or as lululemon puts it, buttery-soft) and felt amazing on the skin. Plus, of all of the leggings I tried, these were the easiest to slip into.&nbsp;</p><p>They're form-fitting but very comfortable — I'd definitely wear these while chilling at home, as well as for hardcore workouts.&nbsp;</p><p>The waistband is perfect, too. It provides support and softly skims your curves without being so tight that you feel as if the skin around your ribcage is bulging over the top.&nbsp;</p><p>The size and colour range are also great. Just make sure you're wearing the right underwear, as this fabric is so lightweight and soft that it will show VPL if your knickers aren't seamless too.</p><p><strong>Leg length:</strong> Full; <strong>Size range:</strong> UK 4 to 24; <strong>Colours available:</strong> 18 colours; <strong>Fabric:</strong> Nylon and lycra elastane&nbsp;</p><h2>YANA Active 2.0 Combat Green Leggings</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Untitled-design-12.png><ul><li><strong>YANA Active 2.0 Combat Green Leggings, ̶£̶7̶0̶ £35 from YANA Active - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Stylish high shine finish, sustainable, suncream and oil resistant, UV protection, 99% squat proof , concealed pocket&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Only available in sizes 6 to 16, only available in three colours, will show VPL if not wearing seamless underwear</p><p><strong>Rating:</strong> 3/5</p><p>YANA Active's leggings are made in the UK from 78% recycled fabric, so these are a sustainable choice. They're pretty high-tech too, since they're resistant to suncream and oil, and offer UV protection.&nbsp;</p><p>What I love most about these leggings though, is that they're a total fashion statement. They have a shiny finish, making them look more like disco pants than gym leggings. And, they've got a concealed pocket in the waistband to fit your key or a credit card, so you could wear them to the gym or to a party — it's up to you.&nbsp;</p><p>They're a little lower-waisted than I like and the fabric is very lightweight, which means they aren't the most sculpting on the list. However, they're still fun, practical and flattering.</p><p>These will show your knicker line though, so you'd probably have to team them with a seamless sports thong.</p><p><strong>Leg length:</strong> Full;<strong> Size range:</strong> XS to XL; <strong>Colours available:</strong> 3 colours; <strong>Fabric:</strong> Recycled nylon and lycra&nbsp;</p><h2>Contur Smooth Move Leggings&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Untitled-design-14-1.png><p><strong>Pros:</strong> High shine finish, super high waisted, breathable, supportive, flattering, comfortable, excellent coverage, UV sun protection, resistant to sun cream and oil&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Only available in sizes 6 to 16, waistband rolls down a little bit&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4/5</p><p>Contur's Smooth Move leggings have a high-shine finish and are super high-waisted, giving them a fun '80s feel.</p><p>And as well as being stylish, they're stretchy, comfortable, and easy to get on and off (which you can't always say for this type of legging).</p><p>Crafted using a sustainable techno fabric and ECONYL regenerated Nylon, these leggings will support and enhance your figure through any workout, all while remaining breathable and keeping you UV-protected.</p><p><strong>Leg length:</strong> Full; <strong>Size range:</strong> XS to XL; <strong>Colours available:</strong> 5 colours; <strong>Fabric:</strong> Recycled polyamide and elastane</p><h2><strong>Lovall Energise Sports Leggings</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/love-leggings-energise-midnight-black-sports-leggings.png><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Flattering seam design and compression fabric, practical pockets, comfortable, supportive, lightweight fabric, sweat-wicking, available in regular, tall and petite lengths, available in sizes 6 to 28, recycled fabric&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Waistband isn't as high rise as I'd like it to be, only available in two colours</p><p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4/5</p><p>Lovall's (previously known as Love Leggings) products are the most accessible leggings I've tried, purely because they're available in sizes 6 to 28 and in regular, tall and petite lengths.

But this isn't always the case, so read our handy guide to the best women's high-waisted gym leggings above, for advice. And, if you can't afford them at full price, then be sure to keep an eye on deals and shop them in the sales!</p><h2>Should you size down in gym leggings?</h2><p>Gym leggings are supposed to be tight-fitting, but that doesn't mean you should size down. Always buy gym leggings in your actual size, because the brand will understand that gym leggings are supposed to be curve-hugging and will have designed the leggings accordingly.&nbsp;</p><p>Even gym leggings in your own size will sometimes be a struggle to slip into, so sizing down might mean they won't fit you.&nbsp;</p><h2>Are high-waisted gym leggings flattering?</h2><p>Everyone's body is different, and different styles of clothes look different on everyone. Generally, high-waisted gym leggings are thought to be flattering on everyone. They're designed to accentuate curves and support your tummy, bum and legs throughout a workout, so they do a similar job to shapewear.&nbsp;</p><p>Play around with different waistband heights, leg length and leg fit to find out which style of high-waisted gym leggings suits you best. After trying out all of the leggings in this article, we found super high-waisted leggings and flares to be very flattering. However, someone else might prefer 7/8 length leggings and a high waist to sit slightly lower than the smallest part of the waist.&nbsp;</p><h2>How are high-waisted leggings supposed to fit?</h2><p>High-waisted leggings are supposed to be tight-fitting. They're meant to sit around the smallest part of your waist (or slightly higher or lower) comfortably, without digging into the skin or falling down. They should be tight across your bum and legs, without any sagging or loose areas, but not so tight that they restrict movement.&nbsp;</p><h2>How to prevent camel toeing in high-waisted leggings?</h2><p>In truth, the possibility of a camel toe comes down to what leggings you're wearing.</p><p>Higher quality ones are less likely to cling to areas that you don't want them to.&nbsp;</p><p>Make sure you're wearing seamless knickers that fit you well to reduce the likeliness of a camel toe.&nbsp;</p><p>Just make sure you feel comfortable and have pulled them up so that they sit at a high waist, but not too high – remember, a camel toe isn't the end of the world and no one is likely to notice anyway.</p><h2>What to look for in high-waisted leggings?</h2><p>Comfort is key when shopping for high-waisted leggings.</p><p>Get a pair that makes you feel as though you aren't actually wearing any at all.</p><p>Longevity is a must too. For example, you can save money sometimes by purchasing more expensive styles that won't need constant replacing.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqysp2Wjmrmmr9OsZmpoaGZ%2BcYORaJmeq6Ritaqzx2aumqGjqbKlecaypGaklZy0qrrGrGY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./taylor-momsen-kicked-off-gossip-girl-jessica-szohr-unreliable.html><span>←</span><span></span></a>
