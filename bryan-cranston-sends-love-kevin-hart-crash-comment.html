He’s a good human. Get well soon, brother. B.” Bryan captioned a candid photo of the duo, which was taken at a press event for the film The Upside in Los Angeles on October 30, 2018. Kevin and Bryan struck up a friendship while shooting the movie in 2017, which also starred&nbsp;<strong>Nicole Kidman</strong>. In the film, Bryan plays a paralyzed billionaire who forms a close bond with a former convict that he hires to take care of him — played by Kevin.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Longtime collaborator Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>shared a message of support</a> on Sunday, September 1, as well. “Stop messing with my emotions brother @kevinhart4real. We have a lot more laughing to do together,” he wrote. “Love you man. Stay strong 🙏🏾.” The duo have co-starred in several high profile films together, including the&nbsp;Jumanji series and&nbsp;Central Intelligence. Rapper T.I. also posted a message on Sunday morning, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>writing</a>, “Aight now Hurry up & Shake tf back ASAP big bro so we can laugh about this s–t….It’s a lotta love & genuine respect out here for you. You mean so much to so many!!! My family’s thoughts and prayers are with you & all of yours!!!! @kevinhart4real.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>As we previously reported, Kevin was involved in a non-fatal accident over the weekend. While the vehicle involved in the accident belonged to Kevin, he was not driving at the time. The 1970 Plymouth Barracuda veered off of Los Angeles’ Mulholland Drive and through roadside wooden fencing before ending up in a ditch just before 1 a.m. The road the group was driving on is known to be windy and dark. Several members of the group — including Kevin — went to hospital for “major back injuries.” The vintage car, however, experienced severe damage from the accident. No alcohol was reported to be involved in the incident, according to TMZ.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/bryan-cranston-sends-love-to-kevin-hart-after-crash-e28098hee28099s-a-good-humane28099-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Fans quickly flooded the celebrities’&nbsp;comments, expressing their support for Kevin. “I’m sorry to hear that. I’m praying for him. I’m hoping he recovers soon,” a follower wrote. “My best wishes for a quick recovery and lots of positive energy !!” and “Best wishes and positive energy for him 💖” others expressed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlpZH16e49qZpuqqZa7bq%2FRmqWsrJ%2BjerSxzZ2qZqSfq7Jut8SvoKdlmJa%2FtXnCq5isoF2YvK65xKeraA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./smokey-robinson-19400219-html.html><span>←</span><span>Smokey Robinson (Rock Singer) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</span></a>
