This way, the shoulder line of your garment will remain in tact and not become misshapen after being hung up for a long time.</p><p>Similarly, consider the weight of the garments you're hanging: if your clothes are generally lightweight, slimline hangers will be suitable.</p><p>However, for heavier coats, you may want to steer clear of wire hangers and cheap plastics in favour of something more robust and sturdy. Look out for wishbone hangers, which are usually thick and often have a central bar for more support.</p><h2>Best material for a coat hanger</h2><p>Trying to figure out which material is best to go for, when it comes to choosing hangers? Take a look at our quick guide below.</p><h3>Metal</h3><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>Slimline</li><li>Lightweight</li><li>Good for trousers</li><li>Often coated in non-slip materials like velvet and rubber</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul><li>If uncoated, can rust</li><li>Not suitable for heavy clothing</li><li>Can lose shape over time</li></ul><h3>Plastic</h3><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>Cheap</li><li>Durable</li><li>Available in a choice of colours and thicknesses</li><li>Unlike wire, won't leave marks on your clothes</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul><li>End up in landill</li><li>Flimsy designs are prone to breaking</li></ul><h3>Wood</h3><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>Looks stylish</li><li>Sturdy</li><li>Ideal for heavy clothing</li><li>Eco-friendly</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul><li>Usually less slimline than wire and plastic</li><li>Cost more</li><li>Contain natural oils which may not be suitable for delicate clothing</li><li>Affected by temperature, humidity etc which can cause damage</li></ul><h2>What to do with old coat hangers</h2><p>If you're upgrading your hangers, you may want to give your existing set away if they're still in usable condition by listing them as a freebie on platforms such as Facebook Marketplace.</p><p>If they're broken, take them to your local recycling centre. Also check with your local supermarket, as shops such as Asda have in-store recycling bins for your old plastic hangers.</p><p>Some charity shops will also take unwanted coat hangers, but it's best to check beforehand.</p><h2>Can you recycle coat hangers?</h2><p>Metal and wood hangers cannot be put in standard recycling bins: you'll have to take them to the metal and wood sections of your local recycling centre.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Plasic hangers can usually be recycled, but it's best to check with your local council to see if they accept them in your household recyling.</p><p>Enjoyed our roundup of the best coat hangers?
