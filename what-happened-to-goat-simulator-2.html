'Goat Simulator 3' was announced in August 2022.</h2><p>Like its sole predecessor, Goat Simulator 3 allows players to take control of a goat whose objective is to destroy its surroundings. Gameplay trailers reveal multiple goats armed with jetpacks, lasers, and armor that can be used to cause even more destruction at once. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Digital Trends</a>, the new environment will be "18 times" larger than the size of the original game. The game will also feature a story mode, a first for the series.</p><p>But fans of Goat Simulator are likely asking where the heck Goat Simulator 2 is. This numbered sequel has never been released or even announced, and yet Goat Simulator 3 is set to release this month. Well, given how absurdly meme-worthy the game tends to be, calling the second game in the series "Goat Simulator 3" was apparently Coffee Stain's way of committing to the game's identity and sense of humor.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In an exclusive report from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dot Esports</a>, creative director Santiago Ferrero confirmed that while the name "Goat Simulator 2" was discussed during development, the team wanted to go above and beyond.</p><p>"Half of the team [wanted] to name it Goat Simulator 2, [but] the other half wanted Goat Simulator 4," he revealed.</p><p>The team was reportedly split between both options, so they settled on the game's current title.</p><p>"It was a compromise," Santiago continued.

If you've ever played the game before, you'd know that calling the second game "Goat Simulator 3" is just par for the course. At least it's not like the <a href=#>Kingdom Hearts</a> franchise where Kingdom Hearts III is the thirteenth game in the series.</p><p>Goat Simulator 3 comes to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and PC on Nov. 17.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGSgp5GperS1zK6jmqyfp3pz</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./13-reasons-why-gym-pic-ross-butler-brandon-flynn-shirtless.html><span>←</span><span>Ross Butler &amp;amp; Brandon Flynn Shirtless Photo Hollywood Life</span></a>
