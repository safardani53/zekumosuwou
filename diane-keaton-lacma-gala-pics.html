The <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>actress</a> was one of many best dressed stars to attend the Los Angeles County Museum of Art’s 2021 Art + Film Gala on Nov. 6 and gave us nostalgic vibes with her outfit!

She mingled with other celebs and looked as happy as could be to be there despite not often attending public events in recent years.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Before she wowed at LACMA, Diane made headlines for announcing her new project with <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Justin Bieber</strong></a>: a cameo in his music video for his song “Ghost.” She <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>took to Instagram</a> to share her excitement over the news with pics from the video and a sweet caption. “AM I DREAMING??? WHAT AN HONOR IT WAS TO WORK WITH JUSTIN BIEBER AND HIS INCREDIBLE TEAM!!!” the caption read.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Diane-Keaton-LACMA-Gala-Sequined-Suit-SS-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Earlier this year, Diane also got attention when <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>she was spotted filming</a> Mack & Rita&nbsp;in an outfit that showed off her fit figure. It included a loose white button-down top worn as a dress and thigh-high snakeskin heeled boots. She also rocked a long gray wig and glasses and although she looked quite different from how we’re used to seeing her, she still looked incredible!</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>She was also seen confidently wearing loose jeans, Converse sneakers, and a checkered button-down shirt later in the day, proving she can look great in just about any set of clothing. Diane is portraying the character of&nbsp;Aunt Rita alongside Once Upon A Time&nbsp;actress&nbsp;<strong>Elizabeth Lail,&nbsp;</strong>who will portray Mackenzie, in Mack & Rita, which is set to be released in 2022.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH5ye49xZp2hkaOybrfEmquopl2hrqS5wGaemqSRYr2qr9Jo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./secret-dangers-lurking-christmas-dinner.html><span>←</span><span>The secret dangers lurking in your Christmas dinner - from overcooked turkey to reheating leftovers</span></a>
