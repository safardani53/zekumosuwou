The&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Award-winning</a> outdoor designer&nbsp;is constantly at work landscaping backyards and pools. Add to this the pressure of running the reality TV show&nbsp;Lucas Lagoons, and the exterior designer hardly seems to find time for family. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>But Lucas appears to have found a perfect remedy to address the issue. What is it, do you ask?</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Well, the expert builder&nbsp;takes the entire&nbsp;family along for the ride. Together with his potter wife, master stonemason mother, and handy mechanic father-in-law, the reality star has been able to find the right equilibrium between career and personal life.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Lucas&nbsp;Struggles To Find The Sweet Spot Between Work And Life</h2><p>As it is apparent in the show Lucas Lagoons,&nbsp;Congdon&nbsp;is always hard at work&nbsp;tending to the task at hand without a moments’ rest.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><p>In the entirety of the show’s run, the&nbsp;Lucas Lagoons founder has created many fantastic showpieces from morphing&nbsp;drab backyards into a tropical escape to creating&nbsp;pools with cascading waterfalls.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The celebrity designer has to accomplish all such magnificent feats with various clients in various places&nbsp;â€‹—&nbsp;all too with a tight deadline, which at times ruin personal plans with family and friends.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>During an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview</a>&nbsp;with&nbsp;Sarasota Magazine, the genius pool maker talked&nbsp;about hurrying through breakfast with family because of a busy schedule. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>However, Lucas makes sure to prepare&nbsp;breakfast for his wife and two young boys before heading off to start the show but ends up with no more than&nbsp;half an hour to have the quality breakfast time. Likewise, most of the time, the TV personality is&nbsp;either on the phone making deals or behind the steering wheel&nbsp;going places.&nbsp;</p><p>Because of the reality show’s requirements, a single cameraman is constantly tailing him and capturing every move. At the same time, other crew members and producers drop by during key points of the day.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>All in all, the landscaper&nbsp;starts work at eight&nbsp;in the morning and ends at six&nbsp;in the evening;&nbsp;after which, it's&nbsp;family time.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p></p><p><strong>Lucas Congdon with Wife and Sons</strong> (photo: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Sarasota</a>) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>The family lives on a two-and-a-half acre land, which the landscaper also turned into a beautiful Eden replete with sprawling pond, pool, waterfalls, and playing equipment for children.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>However, the time that Lucas spends with family is not enough, and&nbsp;he confessed to the magazine about finding it hard to strike the right balance between family time and business.</p><h2>Lucas’ Wife Galen Is A Potter, Blogger, And A Beauty Junkie</h2><p>While Lucas Congdon's wife&nbsp;Galen can sometimes be seen in the show trending to housework and taking care of her two boys, she is not just a housewife. Much like the talented&nbsp;husband, Galen&nbsp;also&nbsp;has a&nbsp;flair for&nbsp;artistic pursuits.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Mrs. Congdon is a part-time potter who also runs a pottery blog. The <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">self-proclaimed</a>&nbsp;"beauty junkie"&nbsp;also makes time to run a small <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">entrepreneurial venture</a>,&nbsp;Little Fire Pottery—an online store&nbsp;selling hand-made pottery and customized dishes.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p>The creative wife's hand-made creations can also be seen in the shop's&nbsp;Instagram <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">profile</a>, replete with wonderful designs and artwork.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite being a talented artist, the pottery maker identifies as being a mom, first and foremost going by <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter bio</a>. Other than these,&nbsp;the mother of <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">two</a> is also involved in helping Lucas Lagoons in his work. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-618 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><h2>Lucas Involves His Family In the Business:</h2><p>Lucas’ mom Jane “Woman” Werley is also one of the main <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">crew</a> members at Lucas Lagoons Inc. Initially, she lived in <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Vermont</a> with Senior Congdon but moved to Sarasota to work with her son.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Jane is a master stonemason and is also regarded as the inspiration behind Lucas's stride to landscaping and outdoor design.&nbsp;</p><p>Accompanying the Award-winning maker&nbsp;sometimes during work is also wife Galen. Being a potter, she undoubtedly provides valuable insights and expertise on the clay molding aspects of the landscaping work. The lovely partner provides expertise and gets to make decisions in Lucas Lagoons Inc. as the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Vice President</a>.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span><p>In addition to that, the landscaper's&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">father-in-law</a>&nbsp;Alain is also involved in the business in a rather significant role as the go-to mechanic. Alain&nbsp;was an aircraft mechanic and now helps out with the business&nbsp;by tending to all the equipment. As if that wasn’t enough, the father-in-law also does babysitting work when both daughter and son-in-law&nbsp;aren’t available.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-174 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>It sounds like Lucas has it all. A good family with whom the exterior artificer not only shares relations but also&nbsp;a passion for the business. We can’t see what he is complaining about!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGipnqSRqbawutKhoKlnnKqwor%2BMnKann5Sku27DyJ%2BcZ6Ckork%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jorge-zabaleta-19700418-html.html><span>←</span><span>Jorge Zabaleta (Actor de Televisin) - Edad, cumpleaos, biografa, hechos, familia, patrimonio n</span></a>
