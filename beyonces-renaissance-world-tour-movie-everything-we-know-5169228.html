The “Single Ladies” artist’s 2023 worldwide performances will hit the big screen in a movie titled Renaissance: A Film By Beyoncé. Queen B’s famous tour first kicked off in Stockholm, Sweden in May and ended in Kansas City, Missouri on October 1. Now, many of the 42-year-old’s fans will be able to catch an encore of the concert in a movie theater near them. Weeks before the movie hits theaters, Bey also gave fans a preview with her worldwide trailer released on Thursday, November 9.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Keep reading to find out everything we know so far about Bey’s upcoming concert film!</p><h2>What Will Beyonce’s ‘Renaissance’ World Tour Movie Include?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>The film, as reported by <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><i>Variety</i></a> and <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Deadline</a>, is expected to include moments from her 2023 live concerts and a behind-the-scenes look into the creation of the album. It was also reported that Beyoncé’s daughter, <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Blue Ivy Carter</a></strong>, could make a few cameo appearances.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>The film is currently in talks to distribute to AMC Theatres. Rumors have swirled that the “Halo” singer shot scenes for the film in her hometown, Houston, Texas, at the end of September. Beyoncé confirmed that the project will hit theaters and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>gave a glimpse</a> at her children, Blue Ivy, <strong>Sir</strong> and <strong>Rumi Carter</strong> in the trailer.</p><h2>Trailer</h2><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-8>While Queen B released the first trailer at the start of October, she released a new global trailer on November 9. Like the original trailer, she gave looks at the concert performances with a few different samples of songs. She also had a voiceover where she showed what the tour meant to her. “In this world that is very male-dominated, I’ve had to be really tough,” she said, via&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Pitchfork</a>.&nbsp;“To balance motherhood and being on this stage, it just reminds me of who I really am.”</p><h2>When Will Beyonce’s ‘Renaissance’ Be Released?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-11>The outlets initially reported that the projected released date for Renaissance: A Film By Beyoncé&nbsp;is December 1 — the weekend after Thanksgiving.<span class=Apple-converted-space> However, Beyonce confirmed the release date herself on October 26 and revealed that the film will indeed premiere on December 1. </span>“RENAISSANCE: A FILM BY BEYONCÉ, in theaters worldwide 12.01,” she captioned the latest <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>promotional poster</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>Fellow singer-songwriter Taylor released her epic 2023 tour film on October 13 and later was <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>supported by Beyonce</a> at the premiere party in Los Angeles. The outlets report that Beyoncé is expected to sign a movie deal that is similar to the “Cruel Summer” artist’s production. Since Bey is reportedly speaking with AMC Theatres instead of a studio, she is expected to earn more than 50 percent of the box office proceeds. <span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-13>Beyoncé’s fanbase — known as the Beyhive — isn’t too shocked about the movie news since the pop star’s tour was a massive hit this year. Just like Taylor’s Eras tour, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>countless celebrities were spotted</a> in the crowds throughout Queen Bey’s tour. Famous young couples such as <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><b>Kylie Jenner</b></a> and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><b>Timothée Chalamet</b></a> and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><b>Zendaya</b></a> and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><b>Tom Holland </b></a>attended a few concerts.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-14>According to several outlets, Beyoncé’s <i>Renaissance</i> world tour earned over $460 million worldwide, which is now the highest-grossing world tour achieved by a female music artist. As for Taylor, she earned around $300 million.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-15>Since <i>Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour</i> wasn’t announced until late August, several films had to move their theatrical premieres to later dates. Among the most popular affected productions were Blumhouse’s highly anticipated horror <i><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Exorcist: Believer</a>,</i> the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><b>Priscilla Presley</b> biopic, <i>Priscilla</i></a>, and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><b>Leonardo DiCaprio</b></a> and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><b>Robert De Niro</b></a>’s <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><i>Killers of the Flower Moon</i></a>.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-16>It is currently unclear whether or not Beyoncé’s potential movie will impact other future films.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8GesKimk5rAbr7Ep5iiq6OWu6SxjLCmq6SUYsGwwdFmpKiumZp6psLEq7CtoJmjtG7DxGaip6enYoJygphraXFn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./celebrities-disenchanted-premiere-photos.html><span>←</span><span>Celebrities At Disenchanted Premiere: Photos Hollywood Life</span></a>
