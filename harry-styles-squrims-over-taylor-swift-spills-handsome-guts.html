This might be a long one," he told Crowe when the subject was broached, quipping:</p><p>"Actually, you can say, ‘He went for a pee and never came back.’"</p><p>Styles did come back, however, and went into more detail in this interview about Swift than at any time in his past.</p><p>For example:</p><p>What does he think about those paparazzi photos from his second date ever with Taylor, when the stars walked around Central Park and the entire world knew basically right away?</p><p>"When I see photos from that day, I think: Relationships are hard, at any age," he says.</p><p>"And adding in that you don’t really understand exactly how it works when you’re 18, trying to navigate all that stuff didn’t make it easier.</p><p>I mean, you’re a little bit awkward to begin with. You’re on a date with someone you really like. It should be that simple, right? It was a learning experience for sure."</p><p>Really, Styles admits,&nbsp;"I just wanted it to be a normal date."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Styles was the one who called off his romance with Swift, allegedly because <a href=#>she was a prude who was more into her cats</a> than she was into getting naked with her boyfriend.</p><p>It was then presumed that Swift wrote two songs (“Bad Blood” and “Style”) about her handsome ex as part of her “1989” album.</p><p>Asked about those tracks now, Styles takes the high road.</p><p>"I don’t know if they’re about me or not…but the issue is, she’s so good, they’re bloody everywhere," he tells Rolling Stone, adding:</p><p>"I write from my experiences; everyone does that. I’m lucky if everything [we went through together] helped create those songs. That’s what hits your heart."</p><p>Does he think Swift has gotten too personal with some of her perceived break-up anthems?</p><p>"That’s the stuff that’s hardest to say, and it’s the stuff I talk least about," Styles says. "That’s the part that’s about the two people. I’m never going to tell anybody everything."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Taylor has never directly addressed her split from Style.</p><p>But she did she say in a May 2015 interview that <a href=#>she wishes a certain former boyfriend well</a>… and everyone assumed at the time she was talking about Harry.</p><p>This wasn’t an especially messy break-up.</p><p>Because it involved two high-profile artists, however, and because details have been so scarce over the years, people remained fascinated by what transpired.</p><p>Has Styles ever told Swift he admires her songs?</p><p>"Yes and no. She doesn’t need me to tell her they’re great," he says of the aforementioned tracks. "They’re great songs…It’s the most amazing unspoken dialogue ever."</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>Taylor Swift Breakup Songs: Who Has She Targeted?</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><p>In all seriousness, however, Styles clearly has no ill will when it comes to Taylor.</p><p>He actually comes across very mature when the relationship is discussed. He has a lot of perspective.</p><p>"Certain things don’t work out," Styles explains.</p><p>"There’s a lot of things that can be right, and it’s still wrong. In writing songs about stuff like that, I like tipping a hat to the time together. You’re celebrating the fact it was powerful and made you feel something, rather than ‘this didn’t work out, and that’s bad.’</p><p>"And if you run into that person, maybe it’s awkward, maybe you have to get drunk…but you shared something.</p><p>"Meeting someone new, sharing those experiences, it’s the best s–t ever. So thank you."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Yup, Harry Styles just thanked Taylor Swift.</p><p>And he said very nice things about her.</p><p>And both stars are single.</p><p>Do you think they might get back together someday?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pvX2WBcLTAq6myZaOpxq2x0maqqq2inrq0ec6vnKtlpJbGrbvRZqqwoZaperS8yKWjrGWYlrulv86mnGafpanAcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./best-car-trackers.html><span>←</span><span>9 best car trackers you can buy in 2021</span></a>
