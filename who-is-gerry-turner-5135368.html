The Indiana native is looking for love amongst a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>group of 22 older women</a> six years after his wife’s passing. So, who is Gerry Turner? He’s the guy everyone is talking about. Get ready to fall in love with Gerry!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/gerry-turner-5-things-update-embed-2.jpg><h2>Gerry Is the First Golden Bachelor</h2><p id=content-paragraph-4>Gerry is making history as the first Golden Bachelor. ABC teased Gerry as the leading man with the<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> first official poster</a> for the season, which was released on July 16. It showed Gerry from behind holding a gold rose with the words, “It’s never too late to fall in love….again.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Gerry told&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>GMA </a>in July 2023 that it was “still sinking in” that he was the Golden Bachelor. At the time, he said he was looking for a “high-energy” partner who could play pickleball with him.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Gerry admitted to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Glamour</a> that his Golden Bachelor journey is entirely “different” from what he experienced with his late wife. “What you’re looking for at the age of 70 is certainly different than what you’re looking for at the age of 20,” he said.</p><h2>Gerry Is From Indiana</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>Gerry lives in his dream house on a beautiful lake in Indiana. Gerry loves hosting barbecues, playing pickleball, cheering on his favorite Chicago sports teams, four-wheeling, and spending time with friends and family at restaurants and local haunts, according to his official bio.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>While Gerry loves Indiana, he’s not totally opposed to moving if he finds the right person. “I think all the options are open; so yes, I would be,” he told Glamour about moving. “The important thing is finding a good compromise, an acceptable sacrifice for both parties. That’s a tough one to get to, but it’s doable.”</p><h2>His Wife Died in 2017</h2><p id=content-paragraph-9>Gerry married his high school sweetheart, <strong>Toni</strong>, in 1974. They had <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>two daughters</a> together, <strong>Angie</strong> and <strong>Jenny</strong>. Sadly, Toni suddenly fell ill and died in 2017.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>“She got robbed,” Gerry said on GMA about his late wife. “For a while, I was having a hard time figuring out if she would be okay. But we always told each other, when one of us go, we want the other one to be happy. She’s up there rooting [for me],” he said.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>In the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>official trailer for The Golden Bachelor</a>, Gerry broke down in tears talking about his late wife. “I took my wife to the emergency room on July 7, and she passed away on July 15,” Gerry said. “It will be 6 years since she passed away. No one is going to replace Toni. But the love of my daughters and my granddaughters pulled me out of a dark spot.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>.<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>@GoldenBachABC</a>'s Gerry Turner tells <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>#TheView</a> he thinks his late wife would support his <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>#Bachelor</a> journey and that having 43 years of marriage under his belt makes him a better partner: "I come well-trained." <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>https://t.co/cVclFZQmjA</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pic.twitter.com/DH9BZdRKnk</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-12>— The View (@TheView) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>September 28, 2023</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-14>During his appearance on The View, Gerry was asked about what his wife would think about him being the Golden Bachelor. “I think she would be excited for me. In the years shortly after she passed, I had mixed feelings about everything, whether I was ready to date again or whether I’d ever have a happy moment again.” He noted that his late wife would approve of him doing the show. “We always wanted the other to be happy in life,” he said.</p><h2>Gerry Is a Grandfather</h2><p id=content-paragraph-15>Gerry has two granddaughters, <strong>Charlee </strong>and<strong> Payton</strong>.
