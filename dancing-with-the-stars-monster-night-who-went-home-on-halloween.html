While Mraz hoped for a “10” from the judges, he was awarded “9s” across the board.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Alyson Hannigan</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Sasha Farber</strong></a> paid homage to her <a href=#>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a> role of Willow Rosenberg, a character she played from 1997 to 2003. Hannigan dedicated her routine to the show’s longtime fans before taking the dancefloor — fangs and all.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Harry Jowsey</strong></a> made a comeback after revealing that <a href=#>he was “devastated”</a> following the scores of last week’s <a href=#>Most Memorable Year routine</a>, and was joined by partner <a href=#><strong>Rylee Arnold</strong></a>’s older sister, <a href=#><strong>Lindsay Arnold</strong></a>, in the rehearsal room as she gave the duo some words of wisdom.</p><p>While Gomez <a href=#>appeared to be injured following her routine</a>, the actress returned for the “Dance Monster-thon” marathon dance — and won, adding five bonus points to their score for the week.</p><p>The “Monster-thon” was four-minutes-long and consisted of two dances — the Hustle to “Stayin’ Alive” by Bee Gees and the Charleston to “Grim Grinning Ghosts (Dance Party)” by <strong>Kris Bowers</strong> — and all the couples danced at the same time. If they were visited by the Grim Reaper, they were sent off the dancefloor.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>While all the stars brought out their scariest looks during the Halloween episode, one duo’s DWTS journey came to an end. Jowsey and Arnold had the lowest score, but <a href=#><strong>Mauricio Umansky</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Emma Slater</strong></a> were ultimately sent home.</p><p>Keep scrolling to see all the performers’ scores from Dancing With the Stars’ Monster Night:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BZrq%2BvyKeeZq%2BZqbVuwMeeZKyskafAbrnOp6qtnaJiu6qzx61ksKCfYsSmutNmn6illWK8r3nHmqOlp6easq97</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tania-torres-19850506-html.html><span>←</span><span>Tania Torres (Reality Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</span></a>
