But then they asked me to sing at every game after that.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/mickey-guyton-super-bowl-56-2022-embed2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>Mickey, who is the second country singer in a row to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>sing the national anthem</a> at the Super Bowl (<strong>Eric Church</strong> and<strong> Jazmine Sullivan</strong> sang it last year), went on to explain that seeing other legendary singers, including <strong>LeAnn Rimes</strong> and <strong>Whitney Houston</strong>, belt out the national anthem at previous sports games has inspired her over the years. “It’s so full circle,” said about now being the one performing in that same position. “It’s really going to show people what I can do, and I hope a lot of fans are going to see me differently.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Mickey being selected to perform the Super Bowl’s national anthem this year is just one of the many ways her music career is rising. The talented songstress is also up for three Grammy Awards in the spring, including one in one of the biggest categories of the night – best country album. As all of her achievements continue to stack up, Mickey has admitted, as an American country music artist, she’s thought about what “patriotism” means.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>“What does patriotism mean? Anybody can wave a flag, but is that patriotism?” she asked. “I can buy a flag right now on Amazon, so is that patriotism? For me, it’s deeper. I feel like a patriot is loving everybody, a patriot is someone who sees people hurting and wants to do everything in their power to fix it. And patriotism is inclusion.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH1ze5BsZqahk6CyunnGrrCtp55iwLa8xKtkm6enoXpzfJFrZKeZpJ68r63LZpinrJiaum68xKudqKqdlruksYyorK2emal8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ryan-lochte-grams-his-own-rule-breaking-gets-14-month-doping-sus.html><span>←</span><span>Ryan Lochte Suspended For 14 Months After Posting Doping Violation on Instagram</span></a>
