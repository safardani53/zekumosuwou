At Orlando’s Olympia High School, he participated in football. Johnson was only rated as a two-star recruit by Rivals.com.</p><p>Moreover, he was not regarded as one of the top running back prospects in the country in 2004. In preference to Eastern Kentucky, USF, and UConn, he chose East Carolina.</p><p>Johnson excelled in the track program at Olympia High School. At the Florida 4A state championships in the 100 meters during his senior year, he came in second to Walter Dix.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/chris-johnson-career-1.jpg><p>Johnson also concluded his senior year with personal bests in the 100 and 200 meters. Similarly, he recorded 10.38 in the former and 21.28 in the latter (the nation’s 24th quickest in 2004).</p><p>He ran a preliminary mark of 10.83 seconds in his junior year to make the Florida State meet final. His 100 and 200 meters best are 10.38 and 21.28 seconds, respectively.</p><p>Johnson played for the East Carolina Pirates while attending East Carolina University on a scholarship and majored in communications. He returned to school after retirement and earned his degree in 2020.</p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Professional Career</span></h2><p>In the 2008 NFL Draft, Chris was selected by the Tennessee Titans in the 24th overall choice. Over the subsequent six seasons, he became a star for the Titans.</p><p>Johnson led the league with 2,006 running yards in 2009 after rushing for 1,228 yards and nine touchdowns in his 1st season, earning him a Pro Bowl nomination.</p><p>He had 503 yards receiving and added 14 touchdown runs on the ground. All of this contributed to his winning the honor of the AP Offensive Player of the Year.</p><p>Chris spent six seasons with the Titans before spending one season each with the New York Jets and Arizona Cardinals (2015–2017).</p><p>In his six seasons with the Titans, Johnson rushed for 1,000 yards or more, but he never achieved it again after leaving the team. Johnson had a brief heyday, but when he was at his best, he was one of the league’s best running backs.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Famous NFL defensive lineman <strong>Derrick Brown</strong> plays for the Carolina Panthers.

Johnson, most recently a player for the New York Jets, was shot while leaving an Orlando, Florida, concert when a shooter opened fire on the vehicle he was riding in.</p><p>The NFL player was wounded in the shoulder, and the incident claimed his companion’s life. Rollie, a buddy of Chris, died in the shooting.</p><p>Chris, one of the best running backs of his period and a 10-year veteran of the NFL, suffered severe injuries from the shooting and worried they would end his football career.</p><p>Chris claims he was just in Florida to attend a concert organized by a friend who was going to enter a lengthy prison sentence. CJ wanted to hang out and say goodbye to his friend before leaving for prison.</p><p>But things went wrong that night, and Chris almost lost his life. He eventually located a physician who assisted in his recovery so he could pick up his playing again.</p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Accused of Plotting Murder&nbsp;</span></h2><p>According to TMZ Sports, Chris Johnson was associated with a murder-for-hire scheme that claimed the lives of two men in 2016.</p><p>According to TMZ, Johnson wasn’t charged but is suspected of paying “a well-known Florida gang member” to kill two guys in 2015 who he thought were shooting at him and a companion.</p><p>In court papers, it is stated that “information acquired indicates [the gunshot] was a gang connected murder attempt on Chris Johnson,” according to the TMZ article.</p><p>One was killed in January and the other in June of 2016 – they were shot as suspects in the Orlando tragedy.</p><p>According to TMZ, Johnson gave Dominic Bolden, the alleged gang leader, “funds and an individual” who could aid him in forming a drug trafficking organization as payment for killing the claimed shooters.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>One of the few players who could alter the course of a game was <strong>Anthony Carter</strong>.

The Orlando, Florida native dominated the league when he joined the Tennessee Titans.</p><p>The first-round draft choice from 2008 went over 1,000 yards in his first six NFL seasons.</p><p>He amassed 2,006 yards and 14 touchdowns in 2009, winning the rushing championship. Johnson added 50 receptions for 503 yards and two more scores. He presently holds the record for most scrimmage yards in a season (2,509).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/chris-johnson-.jpg><p>Johnson was named the 2009 NFL Offensive Player of the Year, made three Pro Bowls, and was once called to the First-Team All-Pro. Sadly, he didn’t experience the same success after leaving Tennessee.</p><p>In 2014, the running back, who is 5 feet 11 and weighs 195 pounds, was a member of the New York Jets. He then spent his final three seasons playing for the Arizona Cardinals.</p><p>During that time, Johnson only carried for 1,686 yards and five touchdowns.

Although there is little information available regarding Brittany’s occupation, several web sources imply that she is a stylist.</p><p>Chris appears to be an avid social media user, yet he rarely discusses his romantic life there. He hardly ever posts photos on Instagram or Facebook with his girlfriend, Brittany.</p><p>On the other hand, his girlfriend occasionally tags her boyfriend in images she shares with him on Facebook.</p><p>We know very little about how and when they met and how love bloomed between the two because Johnson likes to keep his love life a secret.</p><p>However, given that the couple’s beautiful baby girl was born in April 2018, we can be sure they had been together longer than in 2017.</p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Chris Johnson: Daughter&nbsp;</span></h2><p>The couple, who primarily keep their relationship private, are very public regarding their kid. On April 1, 2018, they welcomed their sole child together.</p><p>Their daughter was given the name Honey Love Johnson.
