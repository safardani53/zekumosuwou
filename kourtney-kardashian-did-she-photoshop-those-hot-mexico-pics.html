You’re welcome.</p><p>Now, once you pry your jaw back up off the table …</p><p>Her Instagram followers were undoubtedly drooling over the shots of her derriere that made it to social media, but they did raise questions.</p><p>Is Kourtney, who just turned 38, doctoring images of herself in light of the <a href=#>Kim Kardashian cellulite photos</a> that recently leaked online?</p><p>Celebrity photographer and Photoshop expert Alan Barry, quoted by venerable Internet <a href=#>celebrity gossip</a> publisher Radar Online, says yes.</p><p>“Her upper left back has been edited in to a perfectly straight line,” <a href=#>Barry explained</a>. “Both of her butt cheeks have been heavily edited.</p><p>"And badly at that."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>The gorgeous mother of three, he believes, went to town on that butt (digitally) "to remove all evidence of any kind of cellulite or marks."</p><p>"I would think they would learn by now.”</p><p>Whether his analysis is true or not, and regardless of whether it matters, it’s not the first time she’s been accused of such not-so-handiwork.</p><p>Last year, Kourtney shared a hot tub photo in Iceland which many observers believed had also been altered to smooth out her backside.</p><p>Then there was the below shot featuring herself and daughter Penelope that was live for just a few short moments before she deleted it.</p><p>Why, you ask, would she – a Kardashian, and by definition an over-sharer – take down a seemingly harmless picture of herself?&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>"Start at her waist," Berry said. "When you come down she has altered what would be her hips down to where her hand is on one side."</p><p>"And where the child is on the other side. I don’t know what applications they’re using, but in Photoshop you would actually use the clone tool."</p><p>"There’s a jagged line. Her daughter’s face has actually been pulled over by the software. Her daughter’s head has been turned into an alien!"</p><p>"If you go above her waist to the bend in her right elbow alongside her body, below her right breast, if you look at that line that would be her torso."</p><p>"That’s been played with. She had a little muffin-top thing going on there and that line has been altered extensively by trying to blur it out."</p><p>"[She tried to] shrink it because you notice on that side her body doesn’t extend out. It’s a flat, straight line from her elbow to her torso."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>That’s quite the breakdown, and maybe has some merit to it, but let’s be honest, we’re willing to overlook a few photo alterations.</p><p>When Kourtney&nbsp;Kardashian&nbsp;takes a trip to celebrate her&nbsp;38th&nbsp;birthday, and posts images like this, we are the ones who should celebrate.</p><p>As depicted in a number of photos and tweets from sister Kim, the sisters had a wild, crazy, borderline naked time south of the border.</p><p>Are we really worried about Photoshop?!</p><p>If she’s trying to sell products using bogus pics to influence fans, that would be one thing, but come on, who doesn’t edit their photos?</p><p>Exactly. So call her out if you want, but that doesn’t change the fact that the gallery below is a gift from the heavens. Or at least Mexico.</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>Kourtney Kardashian Birthday Pics: Bikinis and Belfies Galore!</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pvX2WBcLfOrqmtppWueqyt0Z2YrKCZlrtusMidZKyglWK9qbvTqKqhp6Biwam70p5koaekYrqmxMicpmaomZjAcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./brett-dennen.html><span>←</span><span>Brett Dennen</span></a>
