The 29-year-old rapper apparently pleaded guilty to a racketeering conspiracy charge in the YSL Rico case and was sentenced to five years, with one year commuted for the time he’s already been in jail. The remaining four years will reportedly be suspended as community service and other special conditions are still pending.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>A statement was also released by Gunna and in it, he claims he didn’t<span> think of YSL as a gang in 2016 when his rap career started, and was only focused on the entertainment aspects, even if it meant an exaggeration of the “Black urban” lifestyle, the outlet further reported. He also reportedly stated that his guilty plea didn’t mean he cooperated against any other YSL members and the pre-negotiated plea, which is known as the Alford plea, acknowledges his association with YSL.</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-4>He is now reportedly focused on looking to give back to his community and wants the youth to know that gangs and violence lead to destruction.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Learn more about Gunna below.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/gunna-5-things-snl-debut-embed1.jpg><h2><strong>His real name is Sergio Kitchens.</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>Fans may know him as Gunna, but Sergio Kitchens is the name on his birth certificate! He did the name change once he got famous. That’s not usual for celebrities, as fellow rappers like&nbsp;<strong>Cardi B</strong>, <strong>P. Diddy</strong>, and <strong>Common</strong> have done the same.</p><h2><span><span><i>He’s collaborated with Chris Brown.</i></span></span></h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>Gunna and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Chris Brown</strong></a> make a great team. The pair first collaborated on the song “Heat” from Chris’s 2019 album&nbsp;Indigo. Chris returned the favor by appearing on the song “Die Alone” from Gunna’s latest album&nbsp;DS4Ever, which came out in January 2022. The album also featured <strong>Future</strong>, <strong>21 Savage</strong>, <strong>Drake</strong>, <strong>Kodak Black</strong>, and more.</p><h2><span><span><i>His career has taken off.</i></span></span></h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>You’ve probably heard at least one of Gunna’s chart-topping tracks by now. The rapper — who is signed to Young Thug’s YSL Records and to 300 Entertainment — hit the Billboard 200 for the first time with his first arrival of 2018, Drip Season 3, which featured<strong> Lil Yachty,&nbsp;Lil Uzi Vert, </strong>and<strong>&nbsp;Metro Boomin</strong> and landed a spot on the charts. Within ten months, the rapper returned for an epic collaborative mixtape with <strong>Lil Baby</strong> with Drip Harder, which skyrocketed to No. 4 on the charts thanks to platinum fan-favorite track, “Drip Too Hard.” He’s released three studio albums:&nbsp;Drip or Down 2,&nbsp;Wunna, and&nbsp;DS4Ever.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/gunna-5-things-snl-debut-embed2.jpg><h2><span><span><i>He was charged in the YSL Rico case in May 2022.</i></span></span></h2><p id=content-paragraph-9>Gunna was one of 28 persons associated with YSL and was charged in a 56-count Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act&nbsp;(RICO)&nbsp;indictment. He ended up turning himself in on May 11, 2022, and was denied bond. His trial was initially scheduled for Jan. 2023 and two months before his Dec. release, he was denied a release.</p><h2><span><span><i>He’s been linked to Chloe Bailey.</i></span></span></h2><p id=content-paragraph-10>Gunna and <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Chloe Bailey</strong></a>, 23, sparked dating speculation in February 2022. They were <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>spotted holding hands</a> while out shopping together at Sunset Plaza in West Hollywood, California. The stars previously attended an Atlanta Hawks game in late October 2021. They also collaborated on the romantic song “You & Me,” as part of&nbsp;DS4Ever.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>Both Gunna and Chloe have shut down the romance rumors before.&nbsp;“Yeah, we’re not dating,” Gunna <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>said at the American Music Awards</a> in November 2021. “That was just, like, a date though, where you just go to the game and catch a vibe… But she’s my friend.” Chloe said <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>on Instagram Live</a>&nbsp;in January 2022. “He’s, like, such a good friend. And I love that song. And I was so happy to be on the album. So check it out if you have not.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2K0trrNmmSrmaClsrN5km9samlobnw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./aaron-tveits-girlfriend-list.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Aaron Tveit Dating Aaron Tveit's Girlfriend &amp;amp; Exes</span></a>
