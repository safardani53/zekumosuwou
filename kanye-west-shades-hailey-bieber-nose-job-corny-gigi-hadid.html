Ye. didn’t stop there, saying that the public and press also “want to shame <strong>Lizzo</strong> whenever she looses weight” and “don’t want to support Beyoncé.” He then shouted out fellow rappers <strong>Future</strong> and <strong>Travis Scott</strong> — who is also connected to Ye through his children with <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kim Kardashian</strong></a>‘s sister <strong>Kylie Jenner</strong> — for “recognizing their queen.” He specifically appeared enamored with Lizzo, 24, saying the singer “is going to change the trajectory of our people cause she’s not promoting the things that kill our people … destroy and control our people.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Kanye-west-gigi-hadid-feud-shutter-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>Gigi and Hailey — who both have relationships with the&nbsp;Vogue&nbsp;editor — quickly spoke out with public messages of support. The <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Rhode Beauty founder</a>, 25, took to her Instagram story with her powerful note. “My respect for you runs deep my friend!” Hailey wrote.&nbsp;“To know is to adore you and to work with you is an honor…the most kind. the most talented. the most fun. the most chic,” she also said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Hailey-Bieber-Black-Mini-PFW-BG-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-8>Gigi <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>shared similar sentiments in her post</a>. “You wish u had a percentage of her intellect,” the Guest In Residence founder said.&nbsp;“As if the ‘honor’ of being invited to your show should keep someone from giving their opinion? Lol. You’re a bully and a joke,” she added. As <strong>HollywoodLife</strong> EXCLUSIVELY reported, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Gigi has “zero regrets”</a> over speaking out against the “Highlights” rapper.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Kanye then responded to both women by sharing screenshots of their coverage — dragging Hailey’s husband<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>&nbsp;Justin Bieber</strong></a>, 28, in to the debacle. “Wait Am I canceled again??? Justin please let me know,” <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>he wrote in a bizarre caption</a>. In a separate post, he addressed the “Baby” singer once again. “Justin, get your girl before I get bad,” the Chicago native said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH5xe49vZqSZnq6ybsPErKtmq5iWsaa%2FjKGYoqSVrnqjtcSbnKtlnqTApnnJqJlmm5%2Bnu7p5xqKeomWYlrGqsI4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./beyonces-renaissance-world-tour-movie-everything-we-know-5169228.html><span>←</span><span>Everything We Know Hollywood Life</span></a>
