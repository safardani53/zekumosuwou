and take down - heavy stages and objects in a matter of minutes," the eyewitness revealed.</p><p>"It was nerve-racking to watch the crew struggle to have everything ready for when the camera began rolling again."</p><p>The showrunner himself was "shouting" in the mic, counting down the minutes and "screaming" for more hands to help on set.</p><p>The insider added: "There were times when there was less than 10 seconds before the break ended and there were still five people on the stage setting things up, adding props and trying to remove all the confetti with leaf blowers."</p><p><a href=#>Dancing With the Stars</a> is known for having one of the biggest TV productions in <a href=#>Los Angeles</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>SECRET SCORING</h2><p>Throughout the three-hour taping, which ended up being over four hours for the audience, the five finalists performed two different routines: a redemption routine and a freestyle routine.</p><p><a href=#>Jason Mraz</a>&nbsp;and his partner&nbsp;<a href=#>Danielle Karagach</a>&nbsp;ended up placing second, while <a href=#>Ariana Madix</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=#>Pasha Pashkov</a>&nbsp;placed third.</p><p>The other finalists included&nbsp;<a href=#>Charity Lawson</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=#>Artem Chigvintsev</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=#>Alyson Hannigan</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=#>Sasha Farber</a>.</p><p>After each performance, the judges - &nbsp;<a href=#>Bruno Tonioli, Derek Hough</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=#>Carrie Ann Inaba</a>&nbsp;- had to immediately type their score into a panel in front of them, which is not seen on camera.</p><p>The scores are then locked in before they even share their feedback with each couple and reveal their score on TV.</p><p><a href=#>Carrie Ann appeared regretful</a> after locking a nine for Charity's tango.</p><p>"You could tell she wished she would've gave a 10," the insider said, "but it was too late and the score was already locked in."</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>COMPETING CROWD</h2><p>Off-camera, there was a competition going on between the left side of the stage and the right side.</p><p>The live <a href=#>audience was competing</a> with each other to win prizes.</p><p>An insider spilled: "There was a crowd handler who was rallying up&nbsp;the&nbsp;audience and would give incentives to make everyone cheer louder during the show.</p><p>"Fans went crazy as the handler tossed a bunch of DWTS T-shirts into the audience. They also had a chance at winning a free dinner and tickets to attend the show next season."</p><p>All the excitement was building up for the ending in which the winners would finally be revealed and given the <a href=#>Len Goodman Mirrorball Trophy</a>.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>After Xochitel and Val were <a href=#>crowned the winners</a>, the ballroom turned into "a confetti bath" and everyone was "covered in confetti."</p><p>The best special effect was saved for last, especially given how long it would take to clean up the big mess.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/12/3211-series-first-finale-episode-864547270.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/12/3211-series-first-finale-episode-864505848.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/12/3211-series-first-finale-episode-864546430.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hxaGV%2Bc4CTaJuwrKNir6a0yKebZqyYmnq0r8SnnKxllpa4pr7YZpurmZ2WerS0zrBkrJ2Tp7K1v4yrnK%2BdkaGypXs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./d-brooks-smith.html><span>←</span><span>D Brooks Smith</span></a>
