We continue to share a believer in that mission and will continue our work together at the foundation, but we <a href=#>no longer believe we can grow together</a> as a couple in this next phase of our lives.”</span></p><p class=xp3><span class=xs1>The couple met in 1987 when Melinda started working at Microsoft, the company Bill founded.</span><span class=xapple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=xp5><span class=xs1>“She had other boyfriends, and I had Microsoft,” Bill said in the 2019 Netflix miniseries <a href=# rel=noopener>Inside Bill’s Brain</a>. “We were like, ‘Hey we are not really serious about each other, are we? We are not going to demand each other’s time.’”</span></p><p class=xp3><span class=xs1>Eventually, after the romance got serious, Bill made a pro/con list for whether he should propose (really), and they decided to embark on a life together. Bill and Melinda married in 1994 at a Hawaiian destination wedding.</span></p><p class=xp3><span class=xs1>The two <a href=#>welcomed their first child,</a> daughter Jennifer in 1996. Son Rory arrived in 1999 and daughter Phoebe followed in 2002.</span></p><p class=xp3><span class=xs1>Though the mother of three eventually stepped back from her job at Microsoft after nine years, she continued working with her husband. They launched the earliest version of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in 1994, and the philanthropic organization — which focuses on global health, education, access to digital information via public libraries, and support for at-risk families — is still thriving.&nbsp;</span><span class=xapple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=xp3><span class=xs1>“<a href=#>Working together</a> as well as raising a family together, there’s a certain intensity to that. But we’re very lucky because we mostly see things the same way, the goals are very much the same,” Bill said in a 2019 <a href=#>Facebook Live</a>.</span><span class=xapple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=xp3><span class=xs1>The Texas native praised the Microsoft founder for sharing the workload with her, whether that meant dropping kids off at school or doing dishes.</span><span class=xapple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=xp3><span class=xs1>“I think people have a certain view of Bill, because he was a high-charging CEO running Microsoft,” the author told&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>USA Today&nbsp;</a>while promoting her book, The Moment of Lift: How Empowering Women Changes the World in 2019. “I think people must think, ‘Oh well, Melinda must not really have equality with Bill.’ Actually, I have total equality with Bill. But it took a while for us to get there.”</span></p><p class=xp3><span class=xs1>Daughter Jennifer, a second-year medical student at Stanford, acknowledged her parents’ split in a statement on <a href=#>Instagram</a>.</span><span class=xapple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=xp3><span class=xs1>“It’s been a challenging stretch of time for our whole family,” she wrote in an Instagram Story at the time. “I’m still learning how to best support my own process and emotions as well as family members at this time, and am grateful for the space to do so. I won’t personally comment further on anything around the separation, but please know that your kind words and support mean the world to me.”</span><span class=xapple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=xp3>Scroll through for a full timeline of Bill and Melinda’s romance:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkr6q4y2aYp5xdorKttc2dmGafkamytHnRnqOarJmku7S0yKlkraGdmrmqusRo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./damar-hamlin-parents.html><span>←</span><span>Meet Damar Hamlin's Parents and Brother Damir!</span></a>
