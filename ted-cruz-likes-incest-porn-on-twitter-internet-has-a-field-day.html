Yes, my misery very much appreciates your company," Mazin tweeted last night.</p><p>Having waited for this day for nearly thirty years, Mazin obviously didn’t stop there:</p><p>“Sadly, the fact that Ted Cruz jacks off to mediocre porn spam is the most human thing we can say about him. This is actually his high point," he added.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>With no fear of putting too fine a point on it, Mazin continued:</p><p>"I never wanted this for any of you. I thought maybe I’d feel better if two or three people knew. Not six billion. That said? I FEEL BETTER.”</p><p>Hopefully, someone in Cruz’s office is coating the senator in a healing salve to soothe his savage burns … and hopefully Ted’s not getting off on it.</p><p>Now, we live in an age in which the media cycle operates at such a breakneck speed that a man who <a href=#>boasted of grabbing women "by the p-ssy</a>"&nbsp;was elected president just a few weeks after his admission of sexual assault went public.</p><p>So in all likelihood, this will all be forgotten by the time Cruz launches his inevitable 2020 presidential campaign.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>But don’t worry – Ted will inevitably trip over his own dong many times between now and then.</p><p>It’s important to remember that this isn’t the <a href=#>first Ted Cruz sex scandal</a>.</p><p>Hell, it’s not even the <a href=#>second Ted Cruz sex scandal</a>.</p><p>This is a guy so prone to self-sabotage that he maintained his <a href=#>connection to Josh Duggar </a>after the world learned Duggar had molested four of his sisters.</p><p>And don’t get us started on all those grisly murders Cruz committed in San Francisco in the ’70s!</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pvX2WGcMDEnWScqqWveq21yp6qZqGemLK0wIyppqumXaS7bsDWoqutnaJitq%2FAxKulnqxdna60ecBmnaKdnJl6pa3YaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./scott-crawford.html><span>←</span><span>Scott Crawford Biography</span></a>
