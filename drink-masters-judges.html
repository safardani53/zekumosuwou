The Drink Masters judges have a job we all envy: tasting creative cocktails show after show. So who are these lucky liquor appraisers? Let’s meet them!</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The streaming platform debuted the mixology competition show on Oct. 28, 2022. On the show, 12 world-class cocktail makers shake and stir away in an effort to win the title of the Ultimate Drink Master. The contestants will need adjudicators and as such, Drink Masters judges with some seriously impressive mixology cred were recruited.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Meet 'Drink Masters' judges Frankie Solarik and Julie Reiner.</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Frankie Solarik</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Julie Reiner</a> serve as sippers-in-chief on the series. Frankie is the author of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Bar Chef: A Modern Approach to Cocktails</a>. He also sells a line of bottled drinks — which are based on drinks from his own world-class bar in Toronto, Canada — to encourage folks to enjoy quality cocktails at home. Frankie's bar was hailed by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Condé Nast Traveler</a> as “living up to” its “lofty ambitions” and a must-visit for anyone interested in the “global cocktail scene.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>As for Julie, according to her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a>, she is a mixologist, author, and consultant based in New York City. Her tome is titled The Craft Cocktail Party: Delicious Drinks for Every Occasion. The esteemed establishments Julie owns — Clover Club and Leyenda — are located in Brooklyn. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Magazine</a> called Clover Club "one of the best drink destinations in the entire city." Like her fellow Drink Masters judge, Julie sells a line of cocktails. Hers are canned and are called Social Hour Cocktails.</p><p>Although she’s clearly the perfect fit for the role of being one of the Drink Masters judges, Julie admitted at first she wasn’t sure she wanted to be on TV. In a post on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a>, the new reality star said, “Putting yourself out there publicly isn’t easy. In the end, It was a great experience.” For his part, Frankie said in part on his own <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> that it was an “honor” to be on the Netflix show.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">‘Drink Masters’ also has a host.</h2><p>He may not be a bar owner, but <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tone Bell</a> is the perfect host for Drink Masters. Why? Because he's hilarious, and we'd watch him host anything. If you recognize his name, that is because the actor has appeared in a variety of TV shows over the past two decades, including Fam, A Black Lady Sketch Show, and The Flash.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">‘Drink Masters’ contestants compete to craft the ultimate cocktail.</h2><p>In typical reality show format, Drink Masters sees a dozen mixologists engage in challenges each episode. The contestants are mixologists from across the country who serve up not-so-ordinary drinks in bars from Las Vegas to New York City.
