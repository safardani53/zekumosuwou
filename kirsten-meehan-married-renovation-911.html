So who is Kirsten married to? Is he in real estate too? Here's what we know.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is 'Renovation 911' co-host Kirsten Meehan married to?</h2><p>Kirsten has been married to her husband, Ted Meehan, for 14 years and counting.</p><p>The Renovation 911 co-host clearly adores her husband, writing in a caption on her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a>, "This guy is 40 (yesterday)! I'm the lucky lottery winner — I won this travel planner extraordinaire, state and national parks enthusiast, organics recycling extremist, butterfly garden conservationist, bicycle spandex wearer, and all around, great human. I love you Ted Meehan."</p><p>It doesn't look like Ted also has a career in real estate, but it's a bit tricky to tell based on social media alone — Kirsten's husband does have an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> page, but he rarely posts anything on it!</p><p>However, Kirsten frequently posts cute couples pictures with her husband on her page, making it clear that the two are as rock-solid as the projects Kirsten completes on Renovation 911! So do Kirsten and Ted have any kids together?</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Do Kirsten and Ted have any kids?</h2><p>Kirsten and Ted have two children, a daughter named Fin and a son named Liam (one of Kirsten's cute Instagram posts featured Liam dressed up as the Mandalorian with Fin by his side as an angel for Halloween).</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Kirsten is obviously dedicated to her family, frequently including cute anecdotes from her home life, including one post from Christmas 2021 where she wrote, "Christmas 2021! Best part, Fin gave Liam two free hugs for a gift and he said that was 'better than anything he asked for!'"</p><p>The Meehan family also have one furry child, a cute dog named Millie! (They started an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram for Millie</a> back in 2020, but sadly haven't updated the page since).</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">When do new episodes of 'Renovation 911' air?</h2><p>You can catch Kirsten renovating homes with her co-host and sister Lindsey when new episodes of Renovation 911 air live on HGTV every Tuesday night at 9 p.m. EST.</p><p>Season 1 of Renovation 911 will have eight episodes in total.
