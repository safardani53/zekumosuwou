It wasn’t purposeful. But it was selfish. But I was lonely and for some reason I felt safe and familiar with him and all my morals went out the window,” Doute wrote about their encounters.</p><p>“My total lack of self-esteem, plus a lot of alcohol, made it feel totally reasonable to commit the ultimate relationship crime. Twice.”</p><p>Kristen also opened up about her abusive relationship with James Kennedy, which was apparently even more damaging than it appeared on the show.</p><p>“By the time he had broken me down, I was fully ready to let it get to the next level. He was jealous and possessive," she wrote.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>"He put me down in public and blamed me for all his problems.”</p><p>She added that James’ abuse eventually reached the level of&nbsp;“shoving, pushing, and physical restraint."</p><p>Remarkably, Kennedy was combative with Kristen during last night’s reunion, and not the slightest bit apologetic.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>As for the Witches of WeHo who devoted the most energy to tearing Kristen down this season, Stassi and Katie Maloney both defended their actions when speaking with Life & Style</p><p>“It’s not just one thing that brought us to this place. It was just a series of years of things,” <a href=#>Stassi told the tabloid</a>.</p><p>“You’ve seen us ebb and flow with Kristen a lot and we know sometimes how Kristen can be difficult,” Katie noted.</p><p>“It just reached the wall, it reached the ceiling.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>On Twitter, fans weren’t so interested in Stassi and Katie’s apologies, and were much more concerned with their continued mistreatment of Kristen.</p><p>"Gotta love how Kristen is catching all this heat for sleeping with Max while Max just sits there unscathed, looking like the boring, racist, werewolf twig that he’s been all season," one viewer tweeted.</p><p>That’s a solid description, although it’s worth noting that Max seemed more sincere in his apology than must of the Vanderpump dudes who have been called out for toxic behavior.</p><p>Of course, saying your behavior looks good in comparison to<a href=#> Jax’s drug-fueled meltdown</a> is pretty fait praise.</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>Vanderpump Rules Season 8 Preview: Stassi & Kristen Flat-Out Hate Each Other!</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2toX2WDcLfRoqqtnZ5isbDB055kmqScYsGpsYywpqadnmK8r3nVmqWdnaKlwq68jKuspZ2jYq6zsYybrKWkmZrAbq3NnWY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./a-blue-themed-baby-shower-for-christina-aguilera.html><span>←</span><span>A Blue-Themed Baby Shower for Christina Aguilera</span></a>
