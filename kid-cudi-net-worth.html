According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Cudi’s estimated net worth is around $16 million as of 2023.</p><p>However, many believe that the rapper’s net worth is much more than that since he has been involved in many ventures like music, acting, and the fashion industry. But since Cudi himself has not talked about his net worth and earnings, it is mere speculation.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Kid Cudi’s career in music</h2><p>Cudi’s discography includes eight studio albums, one compilation album, one box set, three extended plays (EPs), one mixtape, 32 singles, including 15 as a featured artist, eight promotional singles, and 32 music videos.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Cudi was born and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">raised</a> in Ohio, and his lyrics typically address his introspection, which he attributes to the perceived challenges of growing up as a somewhat detached striving musician.</p><p>Cudi began his musical career in 2003, leaving his birthplace of Cleveland to pursue a musical career in New York City.&nbsp;He released the song ‘Day ‘n’ Nite’ in November 2007, which received little attention on sites such as MySpace and numerous underground music blogs.</p><p>The next year, it piqued the interest of Plain Pat, the then-manager of high-profile rapper Kanye West, whom Cudi had met two years previously.&nbsp;In a joint venture with Universal Motown Records, West signed the singer to his label GOOD Music, and the company re-released ‘Day ‘n’ Nite’ as his first song.</p><p>Man on the Moon: The End of Day, Cudi’s debut album, was released in September 2009 to critical acclaim and financial success. The album was named one of Rolling Stone’s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, got RIAA quadruple platinum certification, three Grammy Award nominations, and is widely regarded as his hallmark work.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>The album also featured the songs ‘Make Her Say’ with West and Common and ‘Pursuit of Happiness’ featuring MGMT and Ratatat, the latter of which received diamond or 10x platinum certification from the RIAA. Man on the Moon II: The Legend of Mr. Rager, Cudi’s second album, which was certified platinum, was released in 2010.</p><p>Later that year, he co-founded the rock band WZRD with long-time collaborator and producer Dot da Genius. Their self-titled debut album, WZRD, debuted at the top of the Billboard Top Rock Albums list in 2012.</p><p>Cudi’s third self-produced album, Indicud (2013), was certified gold by the RIAA and generated the platinum-selling single ‘Just What I Am.’ After leaving GOOD Music, he released the experimental and lukewarmly acclaimed avant-garde albums Satellite Flight: The Journey to Mother Moon (2014) and Speedin’ Bullet 2 Heaven (2015), the latter headed by the grunge-inspired track ‘Confused!’&nbsp;</p><p>Passion, Pain & Demon Slayin’ (2016), his sixth album, received positive reviews and was accompanied by the first song ‘Surfin’ with Pharrell Williams. Cudi later created the duo Kids See Ghosts with West in 2018, releasing their self-titled debut album to tremendous critical acclaim the same year.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Cudi achieved his first number-one record on the US Billboard Hot 100 list in April 2020 with the single ‘The Scotts’ featuring Travis Scott, predicting the release of his seventh album, Man on the Moon III: The Chosen (2020), to commercial revival and favorable praise.</p><p>Cudi released his eighth album, Entergalactic (2022), to coincide with his critically acclaimed adult animated special of the same name.</p><p>According to the Recording Industry Association of America (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">RIAA</a>), Cudi has sold a total of 22 million albums in the United States as of June 2020. Among the many accolades he has won, he has received two Grammy Awards out of five nominations.&nbsp;</p><p>Cudi is widely regarded as a major <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">influence</a> on several modern hip-hop and alternative musicians. His songs are frequently personal, addressing childhood struggles with despair, loneliness, and alienation, as well as his mature fight with alcohol and drugs and themes of spirituality, grief, dissipation, and celebration.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>The majority of his influence originates from his ability to show vulnerability and discuss mental health issues. He is also known for his experimental music, which incorporates elements of psychedelia, R&B, electronica, synthpop, dance, house, punk, and indie rock.&nbsp;</p><p>Looking at his elaborate discography, it is no wonder that Cudi’s music career contributed to his net worth.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Kid Cudi’s acting career</h2><p>Cudi had a special <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">appearance</a> as himself on the American television show One Tree Hill in 2010, singing his Man on the Moon II track ‘Erase Me’ throughout the episode.
