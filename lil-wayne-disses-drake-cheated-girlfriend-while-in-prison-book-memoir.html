In his new memoir “Gone Til’ November”, the 33-year-old takes stories he wrote in his prison diary and is putting them to life, including how <strong>Drake</strong>, 29, admitted to hooking up with his girlfriend while Weezy was doing an eight month prison stint on weapons charges in 2010.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>[jwplatform TiL6DoOo]</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>The pair was labelmates at Young Money at the time when stories that <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Drizzy hooked up with</a> <strong>Tammy Torres</strong> began circulating. Drake paid Wayne — real name <strong>Dwayne Carter Jr</strong>. — a visit while he was locked up in Rikers Island correctional facility and confirmed the awful news. “Finding out that she f***ed Drake was the absolute worst thing I could have found out. Drizzy came to see me, he was like, ‘Yeah, it’s true’. Damn! This is the type of s**t a man never wants to find out while he is locked up,” he writes in the new book. Day-um Drake! Way to kick&nbsp;a guy when he’s down, not to mention what a total violation of the guy-code.</p><h3>Pics: Lil’ Wayne’s final performances</h3><p id=content-paragraph-5>Fortunately for Lil’ Wayne, not all visits by his celebrity rapper friends were so heartbreaking and awful. He details how superstars like <strong>Kanye West</strong>, 39, and <strong>P. Diddy</strong>, 46, came by to lift his spirits, and thankfully didn’t spill such hurtful news.&nbsp;It’s amazing that Drizzy and Weezy were able to patch things up after something so painful, as they later went on to become tour partners in 2014&nbsp;and are still friends to this day.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6><strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>, what do you think about Lil’ Wayne’s confirmation that Drizzy betrayed him so badly? Do you think it was wrong for Drake to spill that news to him while he was locked up?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlmZH16e5FvZqWhnGLEosXNnmSdoaOosrR5w6uYpJ1dmLWmrdOem2afmae5p77InqWdZaedtq2xjKKlZqiinsCwuoybpqijXaKyrrvIq2Y%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kristin-chenoweth-says-her-new-pixie-cut-was-inspired-by-charlize-theron-jenna-elfman-2013311.html><span>←</span><span>Kristin Chenoweth Pixie Cut: Inspired By Charlie Theron, Jenna Elfman</span></a>
