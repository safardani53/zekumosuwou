But Madonna’s latest attempt to keep herself in the limelight by claiming to be gay is her most ridiculous bid for attention yet.
The 64-year-old superstar made a bizarre ten-second video on TikTok in which she appears to come out.
Captioned “If I miss, I’m gay”, the clip shows Madonna throwing a pair of pink knickers at a bin — and missing."><meta name=author content="Jenniffer Sheldon"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

I don’t recognise her!</p><p>“Honestly, what’s she done? She was so beautiful. Why, why, why do women do this to themselves?</p><p>“She looks like a boiled egg — she doesn’t look like she’s got any features. I’m cross because I really like her — I really do.”</p><p>Millions of her adoring fans will agree, as the once-groundbreaking singer continues to destroy her legacy and image.</p><p>It is part of a desperate decline into attention-grabbing nonsense which makes even <a href=#>Katie Price</a> look like a shy and retiring type.</p><p>Fans are desperate to see her return to being the world’s most groundbreaking and revolutionary pop star, who has inspired artists for decades.</p><p>But younger generations are now seeing a tarnished legacy of a woman who seems intent on stooping to embarrassing stunts in order to hang on to a semblance of relevance.</p><p>I’m not saying that at her age, she ought to be sitting back with a cuppa and watching Pointless.</p><p>As an undisputed megastar, she could easily build on her incredible career by working on new music or going on a world tour.</p><p>Instead, her focus is on shock tactics to get people talking about her — which is only driving her further and further away from the A-list status she deserves.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/c592c877-f616-422b-a183-0ff9a2cea4fe.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/e70602ae-fe58-419c-ba3f-5318c52ce337.jpg><p>I have been a lifelong Madonna fan, spending hundreds on concert tickets and hungrily studying every album she has released.</p><p>During lockdown, my housemates even started to mock me for the amount of time I spent rewatching her old performances on YouTube.</p><p>But more recently I and many others have been left cringing at her increasingly baffling social media posts.</p><p>They frequently feature her looking heavily airbrushed in all sorts of explicit poses.</p><p>In May, <a href=#>Instagram even banned her</a> from doing live broadcasts on the platform after she repeatedly broke the app’s rules regarding nudity.</p><p>She said sarcastically at the time: “It’s weird. They’re being really mysterious about why — they’re not giving me a reason.</p><p>"It’s like a bureaucracy inside a computer.</p><p>“I haven’t done anything lately, nothing crazy this week anyways.</p><p>“I’ve never worn so many clothes in my life.”</p><p>On top of that, she has risked ruining her iconic musical legacy with a series of remixes and remakes of her hits which have done nothing but turn off her fans.</p><p>Those have involved desperate stunts too, with Madonna most recently <a href=#>teaming up with a Dominican OnlyFans personality</a> called Tokischa on a new version of the 2005 No1 single, Hung Up.</p><p>Funnily enough, that edition of the track didn’t trouble the charts.</p><p>Speaking in July, she said she wants to celebrate her 40-year back catalogue, telling Variety: “I’m just looking for interesting, fun ways to re-release my catalogue and introduce my music to a new generation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/madonna-angel-watching-695906068.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/madonna-chucks-pair-pink-knickers-767043484.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/madonna-63-posts-cryptic-message-729002910.jpg><p>"I’m focused on that.”</p><p>But many feel she is better off protecting her legacy and having some dignity rather than attempting to emulate modern pop stars.</p><h2>Butted heads</h2><p>The next potential catastrophe for Madonna’s once-soaring career is likely to come in the form of her troubled biopic, which is provisionally titled Little Sparrow.</p><p>Oscar-nominated co-writer <a href=#>Diablo Cody dropped out of the project</a> after she was rumoured to have butted heads with the stubborn star.</p><p>She was replaced by playwright Erin Cressida Wilson — but despite several script rewrites and being in the works for years, the troubled movie is still nowhere near production.</p><p>Sources working on the project have said they fear the entire movie is doomed because of Madonna’s increasingly unconventional vision.</p><p>It has become such a self- indulgent adventure for Madonna, who plans to direct the film, that some fear it will never see the light of day.</p><p>And if the movie is eventually released, there are even doubts whether it will be a commercial success.</p><p>Emmy-winning Ozark actress Julia Garner was reported to have been offered the opportunity to play Madonna on screen, but who could blame her if she decided against it?</p><p><a href=#>Madonna has six kids</a>: <a href=#>Lourdes, 25</a>, <a href=#>Rocco, 22</a>, David Banda, 17, Mercy James, 16, and twins Stelle and Estere, ten.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The Sun">Read More on The Sun</h2><p>They must live incredibly privileged lives.</p><p>But if we are cringing at their mum’s capers, I dread to think how they feel when they log on to social media.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/britney-spears-left-madonna-kiss-2966422.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/madonna-chucks-pair-pink-knickers-767043542.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2huZGZ%2BdYGWaKSanJ%2Bju6J5xpqwZqqZmbakwcuorKxlo6nCr8CO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lush-fans-frenzy-snow-fairy-scented-candle-released.html><span>←</span><span>Lush Snow Fairy candle is FINALLY released - and fans are in a frenzy</span></a>
