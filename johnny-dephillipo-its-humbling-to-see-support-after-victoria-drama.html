After making a series of accusations against each other about their allegedly toxic romance, the Bachelor season 24 alum confirmed she is now dating Greg. The <a href=#>couple have since shared their side of the story</a> — and denied having an affair — on the “Viall Files” podcast.</p><p>“What podcast? I don’t know anything,” Johnny told Us on Tuesday when asked about their explosive interview.</p><p><a href=#>While he also confirmed that he didn’t listen to the episode</a>, he admitted that it “helps” for everything to be out in the open after weeks of speculation about his relationship with Victoria — and her relationship with Greg — leading up to the finale.</p><p>“I feel like it’s part of the grieving process,” he told Us. “And just kind of getting everything in the open and now you can kind of make that step forward. I feel good about everything. I feel like I’m in a good place and I’m getting over it.”</p><p>Johnny added that he’s ready to get back out on the dating scene.</p><p>“Hell yeah, I’m ready to date again!” he said, explaining that he’s still “working on me” but open to all possibilities. “I just want to have fun, but if something comes along, I’m not looking, but if it hits me, I’m all for it.”</p><p>When asked about his type, he noted: “No type. Just gotta get along with them. … Just be outgoing, positive, just have a good time.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>As for a return to Mexico, he certainly isn’t taking it off the table. “Depends,” he said. “We’ll see. If I’m taken, no, but we’ll see.”</p><p>With reporting by Hannah Kahn</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKGooJ6jxm6wxKmfoqScnr2wecitqmagpaKvrbXNoGStp12osqZ50q6nqaeiqXqistOeqWaumZjBsL7ImmSdqpGirnA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./christina-brucato-career-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Inside Christina Brucatos Career Highlights And Net Worth</span></a>
