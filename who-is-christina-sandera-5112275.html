The birthday soiree came around the same time as Clint signed on to direct a new film, Juror No. 2, starring<strong> Toni Collette</strong> and <strong>Nicholas Hoult</strong>, according to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Hollywood Reporter</a>. Clint’s last movie was 2021’s Cry Macho, making this his 46th go in the director’s chair. His previous efforts landed him two Best Director Oscars, for 1992’s Unforgiven and 2004’s Million Dollar Baby.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Christina-Sandera-spl-embed-3-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>While Clint’s silver screen career has been inspiring to say the least, his private life is just as impressive.&nbsp; The San Francisco native has been <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>married twice</a>, shares <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>eight children with several women</a> and has been in a relationship with <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Christina Sandera</strong> </a>since 2014. Of course, Clint is notoriously private about his private life, as he told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>CBS News</a> in 2004, “There are other people that are involved there and they’re vulnerable people. I can protect myself, but they can’t.” With that in mind, let’s find out more about Christina, below.</p><h2>Where Did Christina Meet Clint?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-4>Clint had picked up the pieces of his broken heart when he reportedly met Christina at his property, the Mission Ranch Hotel in Carmel-by-the-Sea, California, the same year his divorce from Dina Ruiz was finalized in 2014, according to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>People</a>. The actor purchased the property in 1986, and spent millions renovating the hotel into a luxurious resort. Christina reportedly worked there as a hostess.</p><h2>They Made Their Red Carpet Debut At The Oscars</h2><p id=content-paragraph-5>In 2015, they made their red carpet debut at the Oscars and have since been spotted together on many more, including a screening of Clint’s film <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Sully</a>&nbsp;at the Directors Guild of America in 2016 and a year later, they were spotted at the Cannes Film Festival together.</p><h2>Christina Has Met A Few Of Clint’s Kids</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Christina-Sandera-spl-embed2-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>Clint has a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>big brood</a> and Christina has had the pleasure of hanging out with a few of them during her time with the actor. In 2018, the blonde beauty was snapped on the red carpet at the premiere of his film&nbsp;The Mule and she was joined by his family, including three of his kids, his granddaughter and his <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>first wife, <strong>Maggie Johnson,</strong></a>&nbsp;per People.</p><h2>She Doesn’t Appear To Post On Social Media</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>However, aside from her relationship with Clint, not much is known about Christina. She does not appear to have any social media accounts, including Instagram and Twitter, at this time.</p><h2>The Couple Have Never Spoken Out On Their Age Gap</h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>Clint has yet to publicly speak out on his relationship with Christina and vice versa. Which means they have yet to comment on their large age gap, which is reportedly 30 years.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2Kwqb7IrKuippFiwKK6w56pmmVlZn5zfpZuZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kbgmudzzm-iijglklmqtnkij-uknrhlv.html><span>←</span><span>Watch Bob the Builder (Classic) Season 13 Episode 8: Muck's Drying Tunnel</span></a>
