It is very comforting," she added.</p><p>The youngest Brown sibling explained the "signs" she gets from her dad who died in February after suffering a seizure in the family's Washington home.</p><p>“He comes through on the radio," she recalled. "It’s so strange because, even on the stations that don’t usually play this kind of music, I will turn on that station, or be flipping through the channels, you hear Stevie Ray on a station that does not play that kind of music."</p><p>She continued: "Or a song that will describe what is happening in my life. It will come on at the exact moment I am thinking about it or thinking about him. It is too strange to be coincidence."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>The matriarch's <a href=#>final moments and funeral arrangements</a> appeared on the Discover show in a recent episode.</p><p>Billy's son, Bear, 34, <a href=#>explained to HollywoodLife</a> why the family chose to air such intimate moments saying: “Dad loved the show and he loved the people so much!</p><p>“We think that the fans and everyone that loves the show deserves to see everything and to&nbsp;see his funeral and all.</p><p>“We discussed whether or not to include it and we felt like we should include it for sure because we believe that is what Dad would want.”</p><p>Bear also explained how he is doing in the death's aftermath: “I am doing alright.
