She’s also worked alongside her musical icons, including Carrie Underwood and <a href=#>Trisha Yearwood</a>.</p><p>In 2022, Trisha selected Lauren to join the esteemed <a href=#>Grand Ole Opry</a>. The 28-year-old musician used the honor to announce another life-changing moment: her engagement! So, who is Lauren Alaina’s husband-to-be?

However, fans instantly noticed something different about the “Getting Good” songstress.</p><p>As Lauren dazzled in a white dress with silver decals, she flaunted a dazzling ring on her left ring finger. Instead of glossing over the ring, Lauren shared with the audience that she and her boyfriend of two years, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cameron Scott Arnold</a>, got engaged.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Grand Ole Opry (@opry)</a></p></figure><p>The lucky gentleman proposed to her the day before her performance.</p><p>"I was welcomed into this family and it was a dream of mine as long as I can remember," Lauren shared on the Grand Ole Opry stage, referencing the musical ‘family.’ "I didn't think this year could get any better, [but Friday] I got asked into another family! After he proposed to me, I said, 'You have to come out on this stage at the Grand Ole Opry.'"</p><p>Lauren’s engagement news took her supporters by surprise, especially because the “Dancin' in the Moonlight” artist didn’t share any details of her relationship leading up to the engagement. Before the announcement, she didn’t post any pictures of her and Cam during their relationship. However, after their Opry appearance, Lauren posted several photos of them, implying that she was done hiding her lover.</p><p>“BRIDE be dang’d, y’all,” Lauren wrote under her and Cam’s post. “My best friend, @arnold.cam, asked me to marry him, and I announced it at my favorite place in the world, @opry. I didn’t know happiness and excitement like this existed. I can’t wait to be Mrs. Cameron Scott Arnold.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Lauren Alaina (@laurenalaina)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Lauren Alaina’s man, Cameron Scott Arnold, doesn’t work in the music business.</h2><p>Although eagle-eyed fans may have seen Lauren and Cam together at some of her events, the couple has kept their romance on the hush-hush for several years.
