Just another thought,” she prefaced her emotional statement.</p><p>“As I’m, like, sitting here getting so emotional,” she admitted.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/10/1012_lpbw_01_toriroloff_amyroloff_zachroloff-1024x576.png><p>Tori explained that she felt so emotional “just because it feels like so many of you reached out.”</p><p>Followers have contacted her “and have just, like, said that as we get older just what we crave in life is to just connect with people.”</p><p>Tori continued: “and find people who lift us up and make us better humans.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/10/1012_lpbw_09_zachroloff_toriroloff-1024x576.png><p>“And it just sucks that we live in such a broken world,” Tori lamented.</p><p>She went on to ask: “that, like, why can’t we all just get along?”</p><p>Tori then aspired: “Like, find your people and hype them up and just, I don’t know.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/10/1012_lpbw_07_toriroloff-1024x576.png><p>“It’s sad and it’s – but I’m also just so incredibly grateful for those of you who’ve reached out,” Tori expressed.</p><p>She thanked those who contacted her “and said that you have found community within anything that I’ve done on social media.”</p><p>Tori continued: “or shared about my family or my kids or anything.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/10/1012_lpbw_08_toriroloff-1024x576.png><p>“And,” Tori concluded, “I just am so grateful to be part of your journey.”</p><p>Being a reality TV star can be a weird situation. Being on social media is weird, especially with a large following. And, if we’re being honest, just being a person is often weird and awkward.</p><p>But it is only natural that Tori would feel touched and perhaps even relieved to learn that her own journey and struggles have had a positive impact upon her fans.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/10/1012_lpbw_02_zachroloff_amyroloff_toriroloff-1024x576.png><p>Of course, there’s an extra piece of context to this.</p><p>For many years, people have noted that Tori appears to be in a feud (to some degree) with Audrey Roloff, her sister-in-law.</p><p>Both women married into the Roloff family by marrying one of the twin sons. But they seem to be at odds … or so fans speculate.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/04/Zach-and-Tori-Roloff-Little-People-Big-World-copy.jpg><p>Why? Well, the latest (alleged) rub is Tori’s recent milestone.</p><p>Just last week, she celebrated reaching two million Instagram followers.</p><p>That’s good news! It also means that she has eclipsed Audrey’s follower count by the population of a mid-sized city.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/05/eye-gazing.png><p>Audrey has about 1.6 million followers on Instagram. Obviously, she’s no slouch.</p><p>But a lot of Tori’s fans — and Audrey’s detractors — have been gleefully chatting about how Auj must be seething over Tori’s heightened social media popularity.</p><p>Audrey uses her Instagram to hawk products (some of them are … controversial) and post her “picture-perfect” family. Tori mostly just shares her feelings and experiences with followers. Yet Tori’s the one on top.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2trX2Z9cMDOq6Bmqp%2BhvKeyjKidn52iqHqovsCtoK2tlJp6tbuMn5inq12Wu6V50q6nqaeiqbKzv4yapKKco6l6sbHRnJyirpWZeqex1J1ksKGknXqiwcOrnLJn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sleeping-beauty-raped-sleep-real-endings-disney-fairy-tales.html><span>←</span><span>Sleeping Beauty was raped in her sleep, Pinocchio gets hanged...the REAL endings to these Disney fai</span></a>
