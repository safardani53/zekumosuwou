I was really happy to be able to help them to find a respite just to take a little time off.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Canadian musician continued, “The owner has allowed this to happen through me, and I was happy to facilitate. I don’t know what their next plans are, but I know that it was reinvigorating for them to spend some downtime.”</p><p>Harry and Meghan have begun rolling out their post-royal projects.
