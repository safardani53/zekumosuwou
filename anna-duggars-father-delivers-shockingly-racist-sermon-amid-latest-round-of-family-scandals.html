News.</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title></h2></a>•&nbsp;<span class=screen-reader-text>Category</span><p>“A hundred-fifty years ago, or 200 years ago when the Blacks were slaves: Did they ever go to Washington, D.C., and have a rally 200 years ago to protest against slavery?” he asked the audience.</p><p>“No. What did they do?”</p><p>Keller went on to claim that the enslaved Americans benefitted from the “good people on the plantations” — their enslavers — who “loved them and taught them how to read so they can read the Bible.”</p><p>Yes, Keller seems to be arguing that the institution of slavery wasn’t nearly as horrific as it appeared.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Not only that, he claims that it was only through prayer, “humility,” and the intervention of kindly whites that the enslaved people eventually found their salvation.</p><p>“They humbled themselves. They prayed. They sought God’s face and they turned from their wicked ways and God made slavery illegal through several white presidents. It worked, didn’t it? They didn’t protest,” Keller ranted.</p><p>Not surprisingly, his remarks were not well-received on social media.</p><p>“I’m pretty sure running away is a form of protest,” one TikTok user observed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“This is why they don’t want books and actual history taught. Ignorant people soak this shit up,” said another.</p><p>“Did he really just blame black people for being slaves and then make white people out to be their saviors? This is why we need CRT [critical race theory]. Period,” a third chimed in.</p><p>Keller’s sermon was littered with countless historical and political falsehoods, including the claim that the Pilgrims came to America after being “burn[ed] at the stake” for memorizing scripture.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>He also falsely alleged that the US voids passports from the Dominican Republic (which he called “Dominion Republic”) because of the country’s ban on abortions.</p><p>Keller concluded his sermon with the claim that the rapture will be happening “soon.”</p><p>We’re not sure why someone who’s so excited about the end of the world is also obsessed with gaining political influence, but the contradiction makes about as much sense as everything else that comes out of Duggarland.</p><p>Anna, of course, has yet to condemn her father’s remarks, and it’s unlikely that she’ll ever do so.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2trX2WDcK3Np5hmnKWctKK%2B0madmqyYmr9usMSloK%2Bdoqh6tLTOnKKippehxm6%2BwJygrKxdqLKzuc6nZJqlmZl6ra3TnqqtZaKkwq%2BwjKidZp6RoratxYysmpqmlJa5tHs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./steven-crowder.html><span>←</span><span>Steven Crowder</span></a>
