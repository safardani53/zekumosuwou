He was seven&nbsp;back then, and Minnie was 6.&nbsp;</p><p>The childhood friends turned their friendship into a relationship&nbsp;when Minnie turned&nbsp;20.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>After 18 months of being together, the reality star decided to leave for Canada, seeking better employment. Since&nbsp;Minnie wanted to&nbsp;accompany him, they married and migrated&nbsp;to Canada in 1980. They celebrated their 25th marriage anniversary in 2010.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>Tony’s wife, Minnie, is the woman behind his success</h2><p>Tony Beet’s wife, Minnie, age 62, was the only other&nbsp;person who accompanied him&nbsp;when he left his native land.</p><p>Upon reaching Canada, the gold miner initially worked on a&nbsp;dairy farm near Salmon Arm, whereas his newlywed wife&nbsp;worked in retail, home healthcare, and the Dawson hamburger joint.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-185 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>After spending a few months there, Tony left his farm job and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">started</a> working as a gold miner.</p><p>Fast forward, Minnie&nbsp;became a massive <a href=# rel=follow>contributor</a> to his success. She currently handles his company’s paperwork and accounting and also looks after&nbsp;their&nbsp;children.</p><h2>How many kids does Tony Beets have?</h2><p>Beets and his wife Minnie gave birth to five <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">kids</a>.

Kelvin is a mechanic, and Mike is a supervisor of the Paradise hill mine. Similarly, Monic was 10 or 11 years old when she first appeared on television.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p>The former was first seen on television on&nbsp;season 5 at their mine, working on the Beets bacon strip machine 1 at Clear Creek.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-187 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The three usually appear in the show Gold&nbsp;Rush, where they are seen accompanying and helping&nbsp;their father’s work.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Tony and&nbsp;Minnie’s other daughter, Bianca, prefers to stay away from the limelight. Her love life remains unrevealed. Therefore, whether she is married, has a boyfriend, or is single is unknown.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span><p>In 2016, Monica disclosed to a fan on Twitter that her sister Biance wanted privacy and “didn’t want to be filmed.”&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-188 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Their daughter <a href=# rel="follow noopener">Monica</a>&nbsp;married in a close wedding ceremony with now-husband Taylor Myles in 2018.

In one episode of&nbsp;Gold Rush&nbsp;in February 2021,&nbsp;Tony was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">seen</a>&nbsp;with his young grandson&nbsp;Eagan, visiting the gold mining site.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_7"></span><p>The proud grandfather took his grandson to the worksite in his car and told him that he might be a gold miner&nbsp;in the future if he put in the effort. He said to his grandson, “In the future, maybe your brothers will show up. We’ll have a whole crew of grandkids, for god’s sake.”</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-4 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Initially, Eagan’s parents’ details were kept private, making the fans wonder which one of Tony’s children blessed him with a grandkid.</p><p>It sure seems like the Beets family is one big happy bunch.</p><h2>What happened to Tony Beets’ daughter Jasmine?</h2><p>Sadly, Tony Beets’ youngest&nbsp;daughter&nbsp;Jasmine&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">passed</a> away nearly three months after her birth on 1 March 1993.</p><p>In memory of his late daughter, the reality TV star got a jasmine&nbsp;tattoo on his hands with his daughter’s birth and death dates.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_8"></span><p></p><p><strong>Tony Beets made a tattoo on his hands in memory of his late daughter Jasmine.&nbsp;</strong>(Photo:&nbsp;Tony Beets’ <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Facebook</a>)</p><h2>Tony worked at the family farm from an early age</h2><p>Tony Beets, born&nbsp;on 15 December 1959, started working for his family&nbsp;in his early teen years after&nbsp;his father suffered a debilitating accident.</p><p>Beets had to make ends meet by milking cows at his family farm and taking charge of&nbsp;men twice his age. He also worked in the pipeline construction business for about three years until he finally relocated to Canada in search of better career opportunities.</p><p>“I became the boss at a very early age,” Tony told <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Mining & Energy</a> in January 2015.</p><p>He added, “So I decided I had to become equal or better than the people who worked for me. My whole life, wherever I went, if I wasn’t a foreman within a week... well, I’ve always kept one step ahead of the rest of them.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_9"></span><p>After relocating, Tony found his passion for mining in Dawson City, in the Yukon Territory, in 1984.</p><h2>How much is the Beets&nbsp;family’s net worth?</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, as of 2021, Tony Beets’ net worth is $15 million. The estimated figure is still over 98 percent more than his son <a href=# rel="follow noopener">Micheal Beets’ net worth of $2 million</a>. Similarly, Techie Gamers&nbsp;estimates Tony’s&nbsp;older son <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Kevin’s net worth also at $2 million</a>. Moreover, Kevin’s younger sister<a href=# rel="follow noopener"> Monica’s estimated net worth is $1 million</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>His huge net worth is the result of his hard work from an early age. He also owns a successful gold mining company,&nbsp;Paradise Hill claim,&nbsp;located at&nbsp;Paradise Hill&nbsp;in&nbsp;Yukon,&nbsp;Canada. According to<a href=# rel="follow noopener"> Distractify</a>, Paradise Hill may have approximately around 42,000 square meters of land.&nbsp;</p><p>Before Beets’ involvement in the gold mining business, he was milking cows in Holland. Now, he&nbsp;is the richest among the Gold Rush cast, including other prominent miners such as <a href=# rel=follow>Todd Hoffman</a>&nbsp;($7 million) and <a href=# rel="follow noopener">Parker Schnabel</a>&nbsp;(<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$8 million</a>).</p><p>According to Looper (article dated 3 January 2022), Tony had mined 16,261 ounces of gold worth $28.9 million. One of his season 7 gold cleanups was the largest in the show’s history at 532.6 ounces.&nbsp;</p><p>In season 9, Tony Beets’ team had cleaned up 4400 ounces, which was the highest cleanup. After that, Beets later took upon an ambitious goal of attaining 9000 ounces for season 12.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_10"></span><p>Unfortunately, he wasn’t granted an Indian River license and ended up settling in more than half his estimated goal. Nevertheless, the team in season 12 grabbed over 4609 ounces worth over $8 million in total, including a single cleanup of 463.94.&nbsp;</p><p>Beets and his wife, Minnie, live in their new Paradise Hill house, which he showcased via a house tour video in&nbsp; 2020. The house's simplicity and the couple’s pragmatism surprised many fans. In the comments, mandy deemed them “humble millionaires.”&nbsp;</p><p>Minnie's favorite part of the house was the reclining chair, whereas Tony was happy with the adjustable toilet.&nbsp;</p><h2>Do ‘Gold Rush’ casts get paid?</h2><p>According to the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Realitytitbit </a>report, on average, the show’s cast members earn between $10,000 to $25,000 per episode.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_11"></span><p>However, the magazine also notes that it might be hard for the miners to make money if they aren’t in the game for the long term because of huge&nbsp;maintenance, overheard, operation, and equipment costs.&nbsp;For example, the Beets team had to invest $5 million in equipment in season 12 but only cleaned up gold over $8 million in total.</p><p>In addition, the teams sometimes may also find other invaluable items, such as the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">mammoth tusk</a> Beets team discovered in season 13.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6m8r8WMm5yerKNiu6bAjLCmq6yYYrGiwcahq56qXZi1qrjDq5ynZpipuq0%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dungeons-and-dragons-movie-easter-eggs.html><span>←</span><span>Here Are the Easter Eggs You May Have Missed in the 'Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons' Movie</span></a>
