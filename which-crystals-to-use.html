She also owns the online crystal shop <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mother Realm</a>.</p><p>Healing from past traumas, anger, resentment, <a href=#>relationships</a>, and many others is something Rossano says is important because it "starts from within."</p><p>Rossano said in an exclusive interview with The U.S. Sun that she discovered the benefits of crystals after suffering from postpartum depression following the birth of her son.</p><p>"I went through what is known as a dark night of the soul," she said. "It's basically going through this massive spiritual awakening, but when you're going through it at the time, it just feels like everything's falling apart.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on Crystals">Read More on Crystals</h2><p>"It feels like you don't feel like yourself. You feel like you're going crazy. You feel like someone came and picked you up, turned you upside down, and shook all the change out of your pocket."</p><p>She said the emotions "manifested themselves as anxiety and depression" and she knew she had to do something to overcome the negative emotions.</p><p>It was then that she started reading books on spirituality and holistic nutrition and realized that crystals are representative of being conscious of your mind and body.</p><p>Crystals are "geometrically perfect," Rossano said, adding that picking the correct crystal will "blend with your energy and automatically raise your vibration."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Health</h2></p><p>Each crystal releases your tension and provides clarity in a world that can feel overwhelming and isolating at times.</p><p>Rossano explained: "When you work with a tool like crystals, it will help you release things or let go of things that maybe you've been holding on to your entire life that you don't need to hold on to anymore.</p><p>"Whether you need to forgive someone or forgive yourself, or let go of shame or let go of guilt or something.</p><p>"You know, everybody carries different baggage, right? And it helps people in that way."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/10/JF-US-PRECIOUS-CRYSTAL-GRAPHIC.jpg><h2>Which crystals should you use?</h2><p>As an individual goes through transitions or spiritual transformations, crystals can be beneficial in more ways than one.</p><p>The type of crystal a person should use is dependent on what they're trying to achieve or overcome, and by opening up their mind to the idea that crystals can help, that person creates a deeper level of spirituality which will allow them to recognize their self-worth.</p><p>Rossano sells her crystals on her Mother Realm website and recommends five crystals for beginners.</p><p>She said that some crystals like <a href=#>Amethyst</a> or Black Tourmaline are more recognized than the lesser known <a href=#>Rose Quartz</a> or Clear Quartz.</p><p>The healing properties of each crystal are specific but can be interpreted in numerous ways such as Rose Quartz which is the crystal of unconditional love.</p><p>This crystal helps with self-acceptance and self-love, but Rossano says its primary function is getting to the root cause of the problem.</p><p>You can place the Rose Quartz in your bedroom for "a harmonic balance of love and peace and tranquility," or you can use it to bring "groundedness and healing energies into your home."</p><p>"It really breaks through the chambers of the heart and gets down to the root cause of the first time you felt unhappy. The first time you felt like you were an unlovable person. The first time you didn't feel accepted," Rossano said.</p><p>"It helps you let go of that time and bring in more light and space to say I've always been vulnerable. I've always been accepted, but there are situations that happened in our lives that drove us off; that throw our energy off.</p><p>"So these crystals, in my experience, help bring us back into alignment."</p><p>The Hematite crystal will help the user feel more grounded, while Amethyst "creates a shield of protection around you," and <a href=#>Celestite</a> helps you cut the cord with people who no longer serve you.</p><p>Rossano said this crystal is particularly powerful because it can affect how you respond to different people and places, and helps the individual recognize when it is time to move on.</p><p>"We have to remove some of these attachments because they're not serving us, but yet they're draining our energy every day, little by little," Rossano said.</p><p>The Black Tourmaline crystal is one of Rossano's best sellers because it can be carried with the person and rids them of negative energy.</p><p>This crystal can be used proactively by placing it at the entrance of your home to rid any negative energy transmitted from yourself and visitors.</p><p>"Whether it's coming from yourself with a negative mindset, negative belief system, or coming from the outside world," Rossano says Black Tourmaline will help.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/10/NINTCHDBPICT000771305793.jpg><h2>Does the earth act as a crystal?</h2><p>It isn't always necessary to carry a crystal with you, according to Rossano, who says the earth and nature itself act as one large crystal.</p><p>Beneath the earth's crust is hematite at its core, Rossano says, with thousands of nerve endings that pull you into the ground, allowing you to connect with the earth.</p><p>This is the reason you feel happier sitting on the beach with your feet in the sand or feeling the grass between your toes. It is an "even balance between Heaven and Earth."</p><p>"Do you ever put your feet in the sand or you're on the beach and you just feel like oh my god, I can really let go, I can really just be, and take a deep breath?" Rossano asked.</p><p>It's the energetic field laying beneath you that allows you to detoxify and let go of any stress you feel in your body.</p><p>"It starts to help your organs release, your muscles release, and you feel like you can eliminate the unwanted toxins whether it's physical or spiritual."</p><p>Rossano compared this connection to the peaks of a mountain that reach toward the sky.</p><p>"A mountain is so solid and rooted down into the earth that the peak is so high in the sky. And it's so prominent and it's so powerful and it's so mystical and magical when you see these beautiful mountains," she said.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>"Metaphorically speaking, that's how we are. We want to be rooted down in the ground with having this essence of not letting go.</p><p>"We are filling up our own cup with more of our own light. And then in turn, when you work on yourself and you feel yourself, you help heal the people around you. You help heal the collective because we're all connected."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57x56YpayYZIN2gJByampnp522pLSMnKmyq6SWubR506hkrquVZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./archie-panjabi.html><span>←</span><span>Archie Panjabi Biography</span></a>
