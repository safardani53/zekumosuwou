The already slim actress was still losing pounds.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Understandably, fans were worried about Roman's weight loss and the potential health problems that might ensue. Take a look at some of these tweets.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Tami Roman looks terrible I'm concerned she looks like she's dealing with addiction or illness — Kasey (@KaseyGirlBye) <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">November 17, 2021</a></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p dir=ltr lang=en>Bruh, what’s going on with Tami Roman?! <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">#ET</a> — Cotton Candy drizzle pop (@Bridget18534346) <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">November 16, 2021</a></p><h2>Tami Roman Opens Up About Her Weight Loss</h2><p>During a recent episode of <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The Real Daytime</a>, Roman revealed that her weight loss was directly correlated to a condition that she had:&nbsp;Body Dysmorphic Disorder. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>As per <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">WebMD</a>,&nbsp;Body Dysmorphic Disorder or BDD refers to a&nbsp;distinct mental disorder in which a person is preoccupied with an imagined physical defect or a minor defect that others often cannot see. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Hence, those suffering from this disorder see themselves as "ugly," avoid social exposure and take drastic measures to "improve" their appearance.</p><h2>Tami Roman Suffered from BDD Since She Was 13</h2><p>Delving deeper into the topic, Roman confessed she had been suffering from this condition since she was a 13-year-old when someone at a modeling agency ripped her body image apart.&nbsp;</p><p>Back then, Roman was an aspiring model, and in her mind, she had all the traits to pursue her dream: she was lean and tall. She stood at the height of 5 ft 9 inches and weighed less than 120 pounds.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>However, when she went to a modeling agency, they stood her in front of a mirror and started pointing out supposed flaws in her appearance. Roman outed,&nbsp;</p><p>She literally stood me in front of a mirror and said, 'You've got backfolds. You've got fat over your knees. You know you need to do something with your chin. Your breasts are sagging.'&nbsp;I&nbsp;went home that night and from that moment every time I looked at myself in the mirror I could find something wrong with myself.</p><p>With her confidence in her body shattered, Roman resorted to not eating, abusing laxatives, and&nbsp;throwing up—essentially anything and everything that would let her be skinnier.&nbsp;</p><p>She even had her mouth wired in 1993 to curb her food intake and accelerate her weight loss.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Tami Roman's Idea of Positive Comments Was Warped</h2><p>In time, Roman lost a considerable amount of weight. So much so that people started commenting on how frail she had become. Instead of taking these comments as a sign to stop losing more weight, she felt as though they were compliments.&nbsp;</p><p>She even admitted to wanting to lose ten or even 20 more pounds.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Thankfully, she sought professional help and was diagnosed with&nbsp;Body Dysmorphic Disorder in 2008. She had been going to behavioral therapy to try to unlearn things she had convinced herself of.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>Tami Roman's Message to Her Fans</h2><p>Obviously, Roman was well aware of all the ruckus transpiring on Twitter about her weight loss, and apparently, it was not at all helpful.</p><p>I put up a picture and you go, 'You're so skinny, I hope you're not sick.&nbsp;I'm praying for you.' Don't pray for me for something you don't understand. Yes, don't pray. I&nbsp;don't know what you know yes the intent behind your prayers. Please don't.&nbsp;Because you don't know what I'm dealing with.</p><p>She said that what people were doing to her on social media was body-shaming from the other end of the spectrum.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKyRorZuvs6mmKdlp5q2qLTTZqOoq6NjtbW5yw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./oscar-de-la-hoya-addresses-claim-travis-barker-raised-atiana.html><span>←</span><span>Oscar De La Hoya Addresses Claim Travis Barker 'Raised' Atiana</span></a>
