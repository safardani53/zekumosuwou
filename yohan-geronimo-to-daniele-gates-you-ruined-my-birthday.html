It’s a recurring issue for them.</p><p>And yet, Yohan seems entertained. He then takes a step that viewers, frankly, did not expect from him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Not only did Yohan express amusement, but he actually participated.</p><p>He later admitted to the camera that it was less about spirituality and more about just wanting to kick the little coconut around. It was a cute moment.</p><p>And, as far as mornings go, it was a very positive beginning for his birthday.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Daniele had big (secret) plans for Yohan’s birthday. So she went out to pick up a cake for him.</p><p>For reasons that only Daniele seems to know, she had not ordered the cake in advance. She just . . . expected to find a sheet cake of the right size, and for there to be someone available to write on it.</p><p>That is often not the case in the United States. Not everyone in a bakery has the training or coordination to write in frosting. Clearly, the Dominican Republic works the same way. Daniele felt astonished and downright indignant.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Eventually, Daniele’s insistence convinces the bakery employee to allow her to write on the cake herself. That’s a weird thing to request, but the whole thing was odd.</p><p>Again, Daniele could have avoided all of this awkwardness if she had ordered her cake in advance.</p><p>Instead, she got a very small cake for a sizable crowd (and her giant husband).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Ostensibly, Daniele took Yohan on a simple trip to the beach for his birthday. But it ended up being more than that.</p><p>It was a surprise party. There were balloons and the cake. She went all out</p><p>Daniele had also gathered Yohan’s entire family to celebrate. That, it turned out, was a big deal.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>As Yohan revealed to the camera, this birthday was a first for him.</p><p>He had never had all of his family in one place for his birthday.</p><p>A lot of adults don’t celebrate birthdays with family, but … never? Oh dear, that was kind of a bummer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Was Yohan appreciative of all of this? Yes and no. He certainly seemed happy with the party.</p><p>Yohan thanked his family for attending. He also expressed his thanks to God for another year of life.</p><p>Then, Yohan chose to thank God for “the surprise.” It sure seemed like he was forgetting to thank someone.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Viewers were not the only ones who noticed. Yohan’s father, Guillermo, called out from the table: “Thanks to your wife, Daniele!”</p><p>Yohan responded by claiming that he had “already thanked” Daniele, something that he said without really looking at her.</p><p>Even if Yohan actually had already thanked her, that would have been weird.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Daniele did not make a scene. It was already a weird situation, as even some of the kids seemed to have picked up on how weird things were.</p><p>Yohan had left her with two choices: remain seated at the table and cry, or quietly excuse herself and walk away.</p><p>She wisely chose the latter.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>To his credit, Yohan did eventually get up and follow his wife to try to gauge how she was feeling. The answer? Not happy.</p><p>Daniele calmly explained how she felt that Yohan did not appreciate her — not just for the party. But, clearly, also that.</p><p>The humiliation at dinner was only the latest incident. And Daniele struggled to understand why he was treating her this way.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Yohan then told her that she had ruined his birthday. And no, not because of the party.</p><p>He shared that she had preemptively ruined his birthday the day before.</p><p>Now, that’s possible. Sometimes, people inadvertently hurt the ones they love. But there are unreasonable ways to feel hurt.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Yohan’s gripe? Daniele’s friend. Yes, he was somehow still perseverating over the guy she used to date who would soon be in the DR and wanted to say hello.</p><p>Daniele wasn’t asking to bone him. She also wasn’t telling Yohan that she was going to meet the guy one-on-one, even though that would be very normal for most Americans.</p><p>Instead, she invited Yohan — her husband — to meet her friend. In Yohan’s mind, her friend being a man and particularly a man whom she once dated, was some sort of insult.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Viewers understand that there are cultural differences at play. But it can be hard to see things from Yohan’s perspective. (And not just because he’s so tall)</p><p>Daniele felt hurt and betrayed and, of course, deeply disrespected. She broke down sobbing.</p><p>She reminded him that she has rearranged her entire life to be with him, because he is her husband and she loves him. And he’s snubbing her in front of his family. Why?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Heartbroken, Daniele headed for the car. She needed to go back home.</p><p>While Yohan celebrated his birthday at the party that she planned, with the cake that she bought, with the family that she invited,</p><p>Daniele found herself second-guessing a lot of her choices. Is this marriage to Yohan how she wants to spend her life?</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2trX2WBcMXOoZinZZeav7C6yKamZqyfYrGiusieo55ll5bBpr%2BMsqauZaKqtq%2Bxw2aksmWSnr%2B1tMOasGg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./burning-love-yahoo-web-series-to-parody-the-bachelor.html><span>←</span><span>Yahoo Web Series to Parody The Bachelor</span></a>
