I am not the same person as I was when I was 22,” she said at the time.</p><p>“At 31, I am currently extremely happy in every aspect of my life and want to avoid potentially toxic situations. However, it was a difficult decision as I love my roomies.”</p><p>But for all her high-minded justifications, it was widely assumed that the real reason Sammi sat this one out was her fully-justified fear and animosity toward ex-boyfriend Ronnie Magro.</p><p>Obviously, Ronnie’s situation has only deteriorated since then, thanks to his increasingly tumultuous <a href=#>relationship with Jen Harley</a>.</p><p>Last week, <a href=#>Ronnie was tased and arrested</a> following an altercation with Jen — so perhaps its no surprise that Sammi has decided to play it safe and cut ties with her Shore fam entirely.&nbsp;</p><p>“Some of the cast members have tried reaching out, but she hasn’t responded to them lately,”<a href=# rel=noopener> a source</a> close to the situation tells Us Weekly.</p><p>“They would really like to still be friends.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>“Everyone was invited to come on the show but Sammi was the only one who didn’t want to,” the insider adds.</p><p>“A big reason for that was because she didn’t want to be around Ronnie. She has been enjoying her life off of TV and didn’t want to change that.”</p><p>And while she may not be cashing any more checks from MTV, it sounds like things are going pretty well for the former Shore str.</p><p>Insiders say her clothing business is flourishing, and earlier this year, <a href=#>Sammi got engaged to Christian Biscardi</a>.</p><p>We don’t know much about the guy — but it’s a safe bet that he’s a hell of a lot more stable than Ronnie!</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>Ronnie Magro: I’m Innocent, Bro!
