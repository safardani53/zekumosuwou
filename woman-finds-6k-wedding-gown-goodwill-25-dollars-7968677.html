She paid just $25 for the dress, before later discovering that it's a Galia Lahav couture design worth a jaw-dropping $6,200.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Osterhoudt showed off her glamorous Goodwill find in a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>TikTok video</a> last week, modeling the lace, pearl and rhinestone-embellished dress for the camera as she recounted her wild story.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I’m making this video because today I found my wedding dress at Goodwill for $25, and it fits me like a glove. It's gorgeous," she began, as she twirled around to show off different views of the gown. "I found it online, and the original price is like $6,200. It’s by Galia Lahav. Paris Hilton — her most recent wedding dress was from this brand."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Emmali Osterhoudt.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>@emmalifaith/TikTok</a></p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Galia Lahav is a much-loved brand for celebrity brides, with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Simone Biles</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Ronda Rousey</a> among those that have worn the designer for their big day.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The video went viral, quickly clocking millions of views — and naturally, people had lots of questions for Osterhoudt, which prompted her to make <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>a follow-up video</a> over the weekend.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"So the dress video completely blew up and I did not expect it to get this big," she said in the second TikTok, before answering one of the most-asked questions: which Goodwill location was she shopping at?</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Emmali Osterhoudt.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>@emmalifaith/TikTok</a></p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It's in Birmingham, Alabama, in the Green Springs area — and it had nothing,” she said with a laugh. "It had nothing but the dress."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Osterhoudt then recounted how she came to find the designer item, explaining that she had gone into the store in search of some picture frames for a gallery wall she was putting together.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I had already checked out, I was about to leave and I saw a section that we hadn’t hit," she recalled. "And so we went over there and boom, it was beautiful and it was there."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She said she had no idea how major her find was until she saw the Galia Lahav label on the dress and looked up the Israeli wedding brand online.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Not surprisingly, people were also very curious to know why Osterhoudt bought a wedding dress when she's not even engaged — though she does have a boyfriend. "Even if I never planned on getting married, I probably would have still bought that dress just because of the value," she answered. "I could have resold it if I wanted to for such an amazing price."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">However, despite receiving quite a few DMs and inquiries from people wanting to purchase the dress, Osterhoudt has absolutely no plans to part with her fashion treasure. "I do not plan on selling it," she declared. "I do plan on wearing it on my wedding day whenever that time comes. Hopefully I’ll still be able to fit in it by then."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She also brushed off concerns that the dress might have bad energy since the previous owner chose to get rid of it. "Will I clean it with sage to get the bad juju out? I will not. I don’t really believe in superstitions like that," she said in her video. "I think beautiful things can come from bad situations and I do think that this dress might have actually been God’s plan or fate."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Never miss a story — sign up for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>PEOPLE's free daily newsletter</a> to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Osterhoudt also took a moment to express her gratitude to the anonymous bride. "I really don’t know how I got so lucky. I would like to say thank you to the girl who donated it to Goodwill because it made my whole entire year," she said. "And little Emmali, who has loved weddings since she was probably 5, is kicking and screaming right now because she’s so excited."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Emmali Osterhoudt's Galia Lahav dress.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>@emmalifaith/TikTok</a></p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She concluded her TikTok by teasing, "Maybe in a few years I’ll make a video actually wearing the dress. Who knows . . .”<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Galia Lahav heard about Osterhoudt's lucky find, and has been inspired to play wedding dress fairy godmother to a few more brides-to-be. The brand said in a press release provided to PEOPLE that it has contacted Goodwill and plans to donate some more dresses for customers to find at their local stores.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It's a reminder that sometimes, life's surprises can be as beautiful as the dress itself," Galia Lahav said.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ6ekuqK6jJ%2Bgp5yjYoOsedaem52hnpx6qLvWp2Sgp5%2BZxKq4y2ZpbmWUpLmtrdGsZHBxZm2DeIM%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bronax-cloud-slides-sandals-amazon-deal-february-2023.html><span>←</span><span>The Best-Selling Bronax Cloud Slides Are on Sale at Amazon for $24</span></a>
