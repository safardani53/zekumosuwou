Kennedy’s assassination, Jackie hired Warnecke to design the President’s memorial with the eternal flame at Arlington National Cemetery.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In the year that followed, Warnecke — an early pioneer of contextual design — and the former First Lady became romantically involved and even discussed marriage on a trip to Hawaii in the summer of 1966.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Jack felt that Jackie desperately wanted to land somewhere and she cared for him and he provided a safe haven away from the nightmares and the PTSD that she was still experiencing over Jack and Bobby,” Taraborrelli, who interviewed Warnecke before he died in 2010, tells PEOPLE. “I’m not sure they would have actually married. I don’t think it was as serious for her as it was for him.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Ron Galella/Wireimage</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But one day, she and Warnecke had a frank discussion about finances.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“There’s something I have to tell you,” he confided. “I’m … $650,000 in debt.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Jackie, as Taraborrelli writes, “told him she was confident he would ‘figure things out,’ sounding — as Jack would later recall it, ‘rather distant.’ ”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After he told Jackie he loved her, she whispered “Goodbye for now, Jack.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>RELATED VIDEO: Did Jackie Kennedy Really Bad-Mouth <a href=# data-inlink=true data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Queen Elizabeth</a> After Visiting Buckingham Palace?</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The news, “pretty much ended their relationship because that’s not what she was looking for,” notes Taraborrelli. “She wasn’t looking to be in a relationship with someone who was in debt. That’s how she ended up with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Aristotle Onassis</a>.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to Taraborrelli, when Jackie told her mom, Janet Auchincloss, that Warnecke was in debt, she responded: “This is not the man for you.” And, notes the author, “That’s when Jackie <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>turned her sights on Onassis</a>.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Ron Gallela/Wireimage</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Jack [who had four children from his first marriage] wanted them to be a blended family,” says Taraborrelli. “They made plans to marry but the problem was Jackie was in the midst of her most violent PTSD over J.F.K. and there was a hole in her that she was never able to fill. She was just too traumatized during those years to be for him what she needed to be — in order to be his wife.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Her intense need for privacy and protection beyond what Warnecke could provide was also a factor.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><i>For more on Jackie Kennedy Onassis’ love life, pick up the newest issue of </i>PEOPLE<i> magazine, on newsstands Friday.</i></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“They had this connection but in the end I think that practical side of Jackie took over,” says Taraborrelli. “She realized that Onassis just made more sense.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Still, Jackie and Warnecke, who designed many landmarks, including the Hawaiian State Capitol, in Oahu, Hawaii, and the AT&T building in New York City, remained lifelong friends. Says Taraborrelli: “He sent her cards every Valentine’s Day. All the way to the end of her life.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Just before her death from a form of cancer of the lymphatic system on May 19, 1994, they had a conversation that Warnecke always remembered.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>David Cairns/Express/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“How are you dealing with it all?” Warnecke asked her, regarding her recent diagnosis of non-Hodgkins lymphoma.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I cry from time to time,” she told him. “In the shower, Jack. Where no one can hear me. I think that’s best.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">More of their love story may be revealed in the near future. Warnecke completed a memoir before his death in 2010, that covered his life, his loves — including his romance with Jackie — and his architecture, which his children are currently preparing to publish.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><i><a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Jackie, Janet and Lee</a></i> will be released on Jan. 30.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ5KkvKy%2FjqOYnKOZmnqssc2nnJ2xXZe8urLRopynnF2Ws7Wx0Wahn6Ndn66kt4ywmKumlZi4pns%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./emma-stone-cries-over-the-spice-girls-remains-awesome.html><span>←</span><span>Emma Stone Cries Over the Spice Girls, Remains Awesome</span></a>
