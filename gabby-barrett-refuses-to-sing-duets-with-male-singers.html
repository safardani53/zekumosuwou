What does that dynamic look like?”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Gabby explained that Cade’s feelings are a huge factor in why she won’t take those duets. “If I’m singing with another man, is that going to make my husband uncomfortable? Probably,” she said. “I respect [Cade] and love him so much that I’m not going to jeopardize my marriage to do a duet with somebody, you know. Like, I care about this a lot more and I pray and hope and know that God will bless my efforts in trying to keep my marriage straight, and not just for a duet or whatever it is.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Gabby and Cade first met while competing on season 16 of&nbsp;American Idol.&nbsp;In the interview, she also opened up about how they met and how quickly their relationship progressed. The pair have been married since October 2019, and they have <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>two kids together</a> with a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>third on the way</a>. Cade also plays guitar in his wife’s live band.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH5ze5FrZqCZkpfGbq7Aq6merKRiv6ay1KycrGWkpHq0tc2gZJ2tlanAbsPIrZ9mpZGhsm6%2FyKeenqqjZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./martin-margulies.html><span>←</span><span>Fame | Martin Margulies net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</span></a>
