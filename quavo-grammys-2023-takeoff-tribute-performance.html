Other musical icons who have passed were shown behind Quavo during the in-memoriam segment, including <strong>Stephen “tWitch” Boss.&nbsp;</strong>An empty stool was also placed next to Quavo with Takeoff’s chain around the microphone. At the end of the performance, Quavo held the chain up in tribute to Takeoff.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/quavo-performance-grammys-2023-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>In the song, Quavo honors his Migos bandmate, and vows to see him again someday with touching lyrics, both reflecting on the time they shared together and speaking about how difficult some things have been since Takeoff was murdered. “I don’t know if I’m the same without you,” he raps. “When I see you in Heaven, I’ma be with my dawg.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Takeoff, whose real name was&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Kirsnick Khari Ball</a>,&nbsp;</strong>was <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>shot and killed</a> at a bowling alley in Houston on November 1. He was 28 years old. His attorney <strong>Drew Findling&nbsp;</strong>shared the sad news of his passing in a statement. “Along with my firm, I am devastated by the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>tragic death</a> of Kirshnik Ball, known to his fans as Takeoff,” he said at the time. “Takeoff was not only a brilliant musical artist with unlimited talent but also a uniquely kind and gentle soul. He will be greatly missed now and always.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>A suspect,&nbsp;<strong>Patrick Xavier Clark&nbsp;</strong>was <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>arrested and charged</a> in December, but he has pleaded not guilty to the charges. He was released on $1 million bond in early January, according to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Variety</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Quavo-Takeoff-GRammy-Performance-SS-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-9>Quavo was a member of the rap group Migos with Takeoff and fellow rapper&nbsp;<strong>Offset,&nbsp;</strong>31. Takeoff was his nephew, while Offset is their cousin. While the group hadn’t released an album together since June 2021, Quavo and Takeoff did release the collaborative record&nbsp;Only Built For Infinity Links&nbsp;just weeks before Takeoff’s death in October 2022.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>After Takeoff’s death, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>tributes for the late rapper</a> poured in from across the music world, including from&nbsp;<strong>Drake,&nbsp;</strong>who <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>toured with the trio</a> in 2018. Both Quavo and Offset each honored Takeoff with <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>statements after his passing</a>. “You will continue to send your blessings down from heaven,” Quavo wrote in a lengthy tribute.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>Offset didn’t <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>share a tribute</a> until two weeks after his death. He shared a video from his funeral and wrote a heartfelt tribute to him. “Dear Take, doesn’t feel real posting you like this…. This still doesn’t feel like reality. I’ve been searching for the right words to say, but there aren’t any that will suffice. Until we meet again, Rest In Power. I love you,” he wrote.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH1ze49uZqqtkau8brPRmqSmsaNif3F%2BkmarmqOVpLOnedOroJutpJp6sbHRn6arpZGjsKZ7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kelly-clarkson-ordered-to-pay-brandon-blackstock-millions-in-sho.html><span>←</span><span>Kelly Clarkson Ordered to Pay Brandon Blackstock MILLIONS In Shocking Divorce Settlement!</span></a>
