Neither Eva nor Michael has spoken about their divorce publicly.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>The pair walked down the aisle in Oct. 2018 and went on to welcome two sons together: <strong>Michael “Mikey” Jr.</strong>, 4, and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Maverick</strong></a>, 3. Marcille also has a 9-year-old daughter named <strong>Marley</strong> from her relationship with R&B singer <strong>Kevin McCall</strong>. In 2020, Eva changed her daughter’s last name from McCall to Sterling. “Marley was born in 2014 and I gave her her biological father’s name. After two months, we became estranged and I raised her as a single mom,” she explained on the Rickey Smiley Morning Show at the time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Eva-Marcille-Michael-Sterling-divorce-spl-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>“And then, the good Lord saw fit for me to meet an amazing man, Michael Sterling, who has become my husband and the father of my later children,” she continued. “Long story short, we all have the name Sterling, and Marley is the only one with her biological father’s name and I saw it necessary and Mike saw it necessary to change her name.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>It’s not clear what caused the previously happy couple’s marriage to unravel. Just last month, Eva wished Michael a happy <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Valentine’s Day</a> with a selfie with him paired with a video of them grinding on each other during a parents’ night out, as seen below.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Michael also <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>shared a sweet pic</a> with Eva with a seemingly heartfelt caption. “My forever Valentine. ‘I am so in love with you that there isn’t anything else,'” he captioned an image of Eva sitting on his lap while laughing.&nbsp;Plus, in Sept. 2022, the lawyer joked about always wanting to grab his wife’s butt alongside <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>a picture</a> of them cracking up. “Eva: why do you always grab my butt when we are taking pictures? You can’t help yourself?” he began in his caption. He then admitted he was “embarrassed” by the question. Eva confirmed their conversation, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>writing</a>, “ALWAYS and I love it”. Sadly, their “always” did not work out.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH10e5FxZqugn5Z6psLAZqSaqpOeua2xjKagnKCRmrluv9OeqaWhnpx6pbXVqKmcnV2ova2102g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./carla-sunberg.html><span>←</span><span>Fame | Carla Sunberg net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</span></a>
