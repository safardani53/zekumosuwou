If so, good news!</strong></p><p>I've found some of the best no-wagering casinos and put them together in this guide just for you. Remember that no wagering casinos are different from the best UK casinos in general, with the most obvious difference being that the bonus you get when you sign up gets delivered immediately, without playthrough rounds.</p><p>Some sites have a game selection containing slots, blackjack, and roulette that don't require any money up-front and are great to try. They're completely free with no strings attached! This review will look at the top no-wagering gambling sites and why they're great for you.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>My top picks for the best no wager casinos</strong></h2><p>Choosing the right online <strong>best casino without wagering</strong> options is a big deal. It revs up your adrenaline and makes you feel like you're ready to take on the world. If you're looking for an amazing experience, you should ideally pick from one of these sites, as they are some of the <strong>best no wagering casinos</strong>.</p><li><strong><a aria-label="bet365 (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener">bet365</a></strong></li><li><a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener"><strong>Mr Vegas</strong></a></li><li><strong><a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener">MrQ</a></strong></li><li><a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener"><strong>Voodoo Dreams</strong></a></li><li><strong><a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener">Pink casino</a></strong></li><li><strong><a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener">VideoSlots</a></strong></li><li><a aria-label="Pink Casinobr / (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener"><strong>Pink Casino</strong></a></li><li><strong><a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener">PokerStars</a></strong></li><li><a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener"><strong>William Hill</strong></a></li><li><strong><a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener">kwiff</a></strong></li><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>How I compiled this <strong>no wagering casino</strong> list</strong></h2><p>I created this roundup of no-wagering casino sites based on my first-hand research, combined with extensive experience in the industry. The only purpose is to inform you about the best no-wagering casinos available so you can win big without having to go through wagering rounds upfront, using your bonus funds effectively.</p><li><strong>Obviously, I first looked for casinos that let you <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">play casino games</a> without wagering anything</strong>. I also checked whether they offered special promotions such as cashback bonuses, in addition to the initial reward.</li><li><strong>My next step was to rank each of the best casinos based on their customer service quality, and overall value for money</strong>. This allowed me to create a list of <a aria-label="top casinos (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">top casinos</a> with no wager options that are safe and secure while also providing great value for money!&nbsp;</li><li><strong>From there, I looked at the overall quality of the bonuses and promotions and their terms and conditions</strong> to determine which of the best casinos without wagering options are worth your time.</li><li><strong>I then looked at their payout rates, <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">jackpots</a>, and overall acceptability</strong>. I also looked at the minimum deposit and withdrawal limit. I found that the casinos on my list are fair with their payouts and rules.</li><li><strong>Finally, I tested out the various features offered by these casinos and compared them with one another</strong>. My focus was on ensuring all the different types of games, including casino slots like Book of Dead, table games, and video poker were available. It was important to note whether the games were compatible with the special features and the no wagering bonus. The number of casino players that frequent each site is also pretty telling of a venue's quality, in my opinion.</li><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The best UK casinos with no wagering bonuses compared</h2><p>Which UK online casinos offer the best no-wagering bonuses? Based on our top 10 operators, the following five have some of the finest no and low wagering requirement promos.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>1. <a aria-label="bet365 (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" href=#>bet365</a></h3><p>bet365 gets our tip as the top casino without wagering requirements thanks, in part, to its welcome bonus. Specifically, you need to deposit and stake £10 as a new customer to claim 100 <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">free spins</a>. Add to this other low and no-wagering requirement promotions, such as the Sunday Free Spins Escalator, and you’ve got an ideal casino for casual gaming, especially considering the generous deposit bonus welcome offer.</p><figure class="figure--responsive-table carousel--interaction-disabled"><table class="table table--fixed"><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr><tbody readability=4><tr readability=4><td>✔️ Newbies get 100 free spins</td><td>❌ Could offer more deposit bonuses</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>✔️ Low initial bet and no playthrough requirement</td><td></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>✔️ Lots of ongoing offers</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>2. <strong><a aria-label="William Hill (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" href=#>William Hill</a></strong></h3><p>William Hill Casino, aka <a aria-label="William Hill (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">William Hill</a> Vegas, is a haven for no and low wagering requirement bonuses. For example, I've seen this operator give real-money customers the chance to win a share of 100,000 free spins. As long as people wagered £1, they went into a draw to win a random prize worth between 10 and 50 free spins.&nbsp;</p><p>That’s a low wagering requirement offer simply because the min wager is £1. However, this is also a no-wager casino bonus. Why? Because free spin wins are paid out in cash i.e. there is no post-win obligation to wager money to release your winnings. This bonus offer is matched by daily prize drops, monthly draws, and a welcome bonus worth 100 spins when you wager £10.</p><figure class="figure--responsive-table carousel--interaction-disabled"><table class="table table--fixed"><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr><tbody readability=4><tr readability=4><td>✔️ Very low wagering requirements on bonuses</td><td>❌ Could offer a few more casino games</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>✔️ Mega monthly giveaways</td><td></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>✔️ Monthly prize drops</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>3. <a aria-label="MrQ (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" href=#>MrQ</a></h3><p>Why is <a aria-label="MrQ (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">MrQ</a> one of the best UK casinos without wagering requirements? Simple: you can get 35 wager free spins in total as a new customer. The Sun's link activates the deal, which means you simply need to create your first (and only) account and stake £10 to claim your spins.&nbsp;</p><p>But didn’t you just say bet365 gives new customers 100 free spins? Yes, it does, but the MrQ welcome bonus has something else about it that I love. That something is the fact your free spin wins aren’t capped and the first five spins <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">don't require a deposit</a>, allowing you to maximize the use of bonus funds without any wagering requirements. A lot of first-deposit casino bonuses limit the amount you can win from free spins. MrQ doesn’t, which means you could win a large cash prize without any wagering requirements.</p><figure class="figure--responsive-table carousel--interaction-disabled"><table class="table table--fixed"><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr><tbody readability=3><tr readability=4><td>✔️ New customers get 20 no-wager spins</td><td>❌ Needs more table games</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>✔️ Tons of weekly promotions</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>✔️ Daily prize drops</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>4. <a aria-label="Mr Vegas (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" href=#>Mr Vegas</a></h3><p>Few UK casino operators are as innovative as <a aria-label="Mr Vegas (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mr Vegas</a> when it comes to no-wagering bonus offers. When you open the casino page, you'll find an array of games and bonus structures that add a new dimension to your gaming choice. The best example of this commitment to doing things differently is Rainbow Fridays an exclusive program in the gambling market. This ongoing offer is open to all real-money customers.&nbsp;</p><p>The premise is simple: you receive a <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">boosted payout</a> based on your weekly gambling activity. Basically, the promo team reviews the bets you’ve made on casino slots, table games, jackpot slots, and <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">live casino games</a>. They then look at the RTP of each game and the amount you’ve wagered. From this, they come up with a weekly prize that’s paid to you in cash.</p><figure class="figure--responsive-table carousel--interaction-disabled"><table class="table table--fixed"><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr><tbody readability=4><tr readability=4><td>✔️ Innovative promotions</td><td>❌ Interface can be tricky to navigate</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>✔️ Weekly cashback offer</td><td></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>✔️ Hundreds of great casino games</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>5. <a aria-label="VideoSlots (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" href=#>VideoSlots</a></h3><p>You don’t need me to tell you that this is one of the best casinos without wagering requirements if you love slots. Why? Because the clue is in the name. <a aria-label="VideoSlots (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">VideoSlots</a> is packed with high-quality spinners and, in line with this, you can claim a weekly no-wagering bonus. That bonus is known as Clash of Spins. For context, Clash of Spins is a tournament.&nbsp;</p><p>To be precise, it’s a series of different tournaments taking place multiple times throughout the week. All you have to do is play your <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>favourite slots</a>. The amount you wager determines the number of points you earn and, if you rank among the top performers, you’ll win free spins. Anything free spins winnings you get are paid out in cash. For this reason alone, VideoSlots is one of the top online casinos for low-wagering bonus offers.</p><figure class="figure--responsive-table carousel--interaction-disabled"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Why are no wagering casino bonuses good for players?</strong></h2><p>No-wagering bonuses are an exciting way for casinos to make the player feel special. It gives them something to look forward to and respect when they start playing. However, no-wagering casino bonuses aren't just helpful in building loyalty; they can also benefit your bankroll by getting you involved in a good number of games you otherwise wouldn't have started on.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>How to claim no wager casino offers from a UK casino?</strong></h2><p>If you're looking to claim a no-wagering offer and make use of it, this section will help you. Some top casino sites offer no-wagering offers to entice more customers to register with them.</p><li>To claim a no-wagering offer, <strong>you first need an account with an online casino site</strong>.</li><li>Once you've created your account and verified your identity (probably via SMS validation), your reward, such as <a aria-label="bonus spins (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">bonus spins</a>, will be credited to your balance instantly.</li><li><strong>Some casinos may ask you for a bonus promo code. </strong>Some may even send you an email to claim your free bonus.</li><li>You can also <strong>look out for daily promotions</strong> when claiming your casino bonuses.</li><li>Then, you're all set. <strong>You can use your free bonus to play your favourite games at your online casino</strong>.</li><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/THESUN-no-wagering-casino-bonuses.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>No wagering casino bonus T&Cs to be aware of</strong></h2><p>Promotional terms and conditions are significant when it comes to deciding on which sportsbook you will use. These terms help set the legal foundation and rules under which all other terms and conditions fall. Wagering terms cover various gambling services, including sports betting and online casino games. Knowing its terms is crucial to ensuring everything goes smoothly. Key to these terms is understanding the withdrawals and max bonus you can receive within the parameters of their offer program.</p><ul><li><strong>Check the maximum win limit.</strong> This is the amount of money you can win during a single game. The more games you play, the more money you can win. Look for the limit section in the terms and conditions. Ensure there are a good number of games from top providers like NetEnt.</li><li><strong>The minimum deposit varies by region. </strong>You can check your casino's wagering terms and conditions to see if it's set at a certain amount or percentage of your balance or a flat fee.</li><li><strong>Check the time frame. </strong>When the terms and conditions state that your bonus time frame is "within 30 days," the bonus will be available to you within 30 days of registration, so follow this restriction closely.</li><li><strong>The deposit methods available to you depend on your casino's wagering terms and conditions.</strong> Some accept debit cards, while others accept electronic fund transfers and check deposits. To get the best bonus matching your preferred payment methods, look for a casino that offers multiple payment options as part of the promotion. For example, Skrill, Neteller, and other deposits from e-wallets (except for PayPal) are often excluded from bonuses.</li><li>When checking the wagering terms and conditions, you will&nbsp;<strong>know the games available and what’s at stake</strong>. Some of the most common games included in promotions are the Starburst slot, Book of Dead, Big Bass Bonanza, etc. but some more niche games can also be part of it. Games like video&nbsp;<a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">poker</a>, bingo, scratch cards, keno, and more are rarely eligible for using your bonus money. You will also know the restrictions on certain games.</li><li><strong>You should also check the slot game contributions to requirements.</strong> You must know the amount of money you can wager per game before playing one, so you can make an informed decision about whether or not it's worth it. You should have a good number of reasons to place a wager so it’s worth your time.</li><li><strong>Be sure to look for the section that specifies the age requirement. </strong>To confirm whether you are eligible for the wagering offer, provide the relevant proofs (age, address, etc.)</li><li><strong>It's also important to check proof of funds. </strong>The casino will use this information to verify whether or not your account is eligible for betting transactions, which means it's essential to ensure your bank account is valid before starting any betting activity.</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Types of casino bonuses with no wagering requirements</h2><p>Online casinos have the power to remove wagering requirements from any promotion, but the deals that typically fall into this category are:</p><ul><li><strong>Free spins bonuses</strong>: No wagering free spins bonuses mean you get to keep whatever you win. For example, MrQ gives new customers 20 free spins when they wager £10. Any spin winnings from those are paid in cold hard cash.</li><li><strong>Matched deposit bonuses</strong>: Matched deposit bonuses are like-for-like deals e.g. if you deposit £50, you’ll receive a £50 bonus. In general, you won’t be able to withdraw the bonus credits, but you can use them to play real money casino games and win prizes. These prizes can be paid without any wagering requirements.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Cashback bonuses</strong>: <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cashback bonuses</a> are great because you do all the work upfront. For example, if you’re able to claim 10% of your losses back, the bonus payment is based on your betting activity. The rebate you receive is paid in cash because you’ve already made a financial commitment.</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading>No wagering bonus offers vs. wagering requirements</h2><p>As you can see from my breakdown of popular UK casinos without wagering requirements, certain offers do require some work on your part i.e. you need to deposit money or stake a certain amount. In this regard, you do have to make a financial commitment, unless it's both a no deposit and no wagering bonus, which is truly a rarity.&nbsp;</p><p>However, this commitment isn’t the same as it would be if you were asked to complete a post-win wagering requirement. Why? Because, in general, wagering requirements (aka playthrough targets) are based on the amount you win/receive.&nbsp;</p><p>Let’s take the <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">bet365 casino welcome bonus</a> as an example. You need to wager £10 to claim 100 free spins. Your financial commitment here is £10, but any prize money you win from the free spins can be withdrawn instantly. Therefore, your maximum financial commitment is £10.&nbsp;</p><p>If this offer had post-win wagering requirements, your financial commitment could be greater. For example, if the playthrough target was 5X and you won £20, you’d need to wager £100 (5 X 20) before withdrawing your winnings. This example alone shows how bonuses without post-win wagering requirements can be better because they limit your financial exposure.&nbsp;This transparent approach is something many players appreciate, especially on a casino site where clarity is crucial</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Playthrough, rollover, or wagering requirements explained</strong></h2><p>Rollover or playthrough is the amount you must win to receive deposit bonuses. A rollover requirement is usually around 35 times the bonus amount and any offer that requires less than that amount is much more favoured by casino players. For example, if the bonus is £100 and the wagering requirement is 10x, you must wager £1,000 to cash out your bonus. It's essential to check time limits and details for such requirements to ensure you meet them within the stipulated timeframe and conditions.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Q&A about no wagering bonuses at UK casinos</h2><p>Here I'll cover some of the most commonly asked questions that UK players have about no-wagering bonuses and what to look out for when searching for one.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>1. Can I get my money without meeting the requirements?</h3><p>If your chosen casino has a wagering requirement, you can only get your money if you meet these requirements. The wagering requirements are a set of rules that define how much you have to bet before you can get any winnings. Note that they vary from casino to casino.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>2. Do reload bonuses have wagering requirements?</h3><p>Yes, you’ll typically have to wager a certain amount of your own money before you can release a <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">reload bonus</a> and any associated winnings. For example, let’s say another popular UK casino operator, Kwiff, offers you a 25% reload bonus up to £100. This means you can get bonus credits equal to 25% of your next deposit’s value.&nbsp;</p><p>So, if you deposit £100, you’d receive £25 worth of bonus credits. You can’t withdraw these credits instantly, but you can use them to play casino games. Once you’ve wagered the £25 in bonus credits, anything left, plus any prizes you’ve won in, can be converted to cash by staking your own money.&nbsp;</p><p>The playthrough on this imaginary offer is 2X the bonus amount. In my example, this means you need to wager 2 X 25 = £50. Once you’ve wagered that amount, the bonus credits/bonus winnings will be turned into cash. That’s how most reload bonuses work and why they have wagering requirements.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>3. Which slot games are most popular for no wagering casino bonuses?</h3><p>Online slot games are great for claiming rewards, and some of the top spinners for no wagering casino bonuses are:</p><ul><li><a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Book of Dead</a></li><li><a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Big Bass Bonanza</a></li><li>Joker Rush</li><li>Legacy of the Tiger</li><li>The Walking Dead</li><li>Football Cash Collect</li><li>Age of the Gods: Book of Oracle</li><li>Blue Wizard Megaways</li></ul><h3 class=wp-block-heading>4. Can I win real money from no wagering casinos?</h3><p>Yes, you can win cash prizes when you use casinos with no wagering bonus requirements. For example, if you claim the MrQ welcome bonus and win £10 from your 20 free spins, that money is yours to keep. That’s real money with no wagering requirements attached to it. So, the simple answer is yes, you can win real-money prizes from no wagering casinos.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>5. What should I pay attention to with no wagering casino bonuses?</h3><p>I want you to get maximum spins value from every bonus with no wagering requirements. So, before I let you go off and get something for very little effort, here are the important terms you need to take note of:</p><ul><li><strong>Deposit methods</strong>: Some deposit methods prevent you from claiming bonus offers. For example, some operators might state that Skrill deposits preclude you from a welcome bonus. Therefore, you should always check which deposit methods are permitted and which ones aren’t.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Deposit amounts</strong>: There will almost always be a minimum deposit limit for bonuses that require a financial transaction. As a general rule, the industry average is £10. However, all operators have their own policies, so check the minimum deposit before you start.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Game and country restrictions</strong>: You can use no wagering bonuses on certain games and not others. For example, at MrQ, you can use your free spins on Book of Dead. Try to use them on any other game and they won’t work. As well as game restrictions, you might find that certain promotions aren’t available in certain countries.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Expiry dates</strong>: No bonus lasts forever. It’s a sad but true fact. This means you need to jump on the latest offers whenever you find them. I'm not telling you to gamble recklessly and spend more than you can afford just to claim a new bonus. However, if you can afford it, get a bonus before it expires. As a general rule, promotions run for seven days to a few months.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Promo codes</strong>: Some no wagering requirement <a href=#>bonus offers</a> are activated by a code. I'll let you know when an offer requires a promo code, but you should always read the terms carefully before you try to claim a reward. I advise you to do this at your early convenience because you typically have to input a promo code when you’re joining a <a href=#>new casino</a> or before you make deposits.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Get more for less with no wagering bonus offers</h2><p>As long as you know what you’re getting into, there are plenty of ways to get bonus credits without putting in a lot of effort. Of course, that doesn’t mean you can just sit back and wait for money to fall into your lap. However, with the right online casinos and no wagering bonuses, you can get more from your time online with very little effort.&nbsp;</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">About the author</h3></p><img alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dansmyth.jpg><p class=article__content--intro>Daniel Smyth</p><p>Daniel Smyth has seen the online poker, casino, and betting industry from every angle.
