I&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>should&nbsp;come back</a>. But I don't know. I want fans to be so aggressive and terrify [Marvel] into doing it or something," she joked. "I mean, that's not a good way to do anything, actually, I really take that back. No one needs to use force."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>asked if she'd be returning</a>&nbsp;to the MCU, she said, "I hope so. They don't tell me anything about my fate," adding later, "I would love to do more."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Elizabeth Olsen in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (2022).</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy Marvel Studios</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While Olsen was open to returning to the MCU, on the other hand, she noted last May that her Marvel contract has impacted her ability to perform in other films. (A rep for Marvel did not respond to PEOPLE's request for comment at the time.)<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It took me away from the physical ability to do certain jobs that I thought were more aligned with the things I enjoyed as an audience member," she said in an interview with&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The New York Times</a>. "And this is me being the most honest."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Olsen said she was forced to turn down a starring role in the Yorgos Lanthimos dark comedy&nbsp;The Lobster&nbsp;due to her commitment to Marvel.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>started to feel frustrated</a>," she told the&nbsp;Times. "I had this job security but I was losing these pieces that I felt were more part of my being. And the further I got away from that, the less I became considered for it."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Speaking of the studio's more favorable elements compared to "horrible" stories told from other studios, she said, “The thing with Marvel is they never tell you to get into shape. They just hire the people and let them figure out the way to express the character. They will set you up with a trainer if you want, but that’s it.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ5WhtrutwZ6roWWfocCmuoyam6%2Bho5rAbq3GmqCnq6Riura406JkpqemnrJusMSao6xlnZa%2Ft7HLZm5uaGVlhXI%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./doja-cat-is-facing-backlash-after-she-made-fun-of-amber-heards-court-testimony.html><span>←</span><span>Doja Cat Is Facing Backlash After She Made Fun Of Amber Heards Court Testimony</span></a>
