The pair have been married since November 16, 2017, and they have a daughter named Alexis Olympia Ohanian. Their daughter was born a month barely before their wedding in New Orleans.</p><h2>Serena Williams and Alexis Ohanian Celebrated Four Years of Marriage</h2><p>Ohanian and Williams celebrated four years of marriage in November. To commemorate the occasion, the entrepreneur posted a few photos of the pair on his Instagram account. The first image on the slide was of the pair at their wedding ceremony, during which he addressed their large party guests. Similarly, in his second shot, the couple was posing with their daughter, Olympia, who was twinned with her mother.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Serena-Williams-2.jpg alt="Serena Williams" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The internet mogul also sent a brief letter expressing his joy at the memorable event.</p><p>“You made me the happiest guy in the planet four years ago, and our small family makes me feel more thankful every day. The 16th of November will always be a very important day for our family “He wrote.</p><p>“Happy anniversary, @serenawilliams – thank you for bringing this delight called Olympia into our lives despite the fact that you constantly fall asleep in the midst of our movie evenings.”</p><p>Alexis Ohanian Frequently Praises His Wife Ohanian frequently takes advantage of chances to praise his wife and their charming martial life.&nbsp;For example, in May 2021, while speaking on CBS This Morning, he spoke up on work-life balance, describing how Williams had helped him to live a better work-life balance.&nbsp;He said that his wife made him understand that he worked harder than she did and that he deserved time off from work.</p><p>“What she knocked on the head was that I had a skewed perspective of the route to brilliance and greatness being a direct outcome of pure labor,” he said to Gayle King, the show’s presenter. He said, “Something she [Williams] excels at is turning it off and focusing on family or personal time. I’m always a smartphone away from getting back into work, and I’m sure I’m still checked on that one from time to time.” Not only that, but he was seen during Williams’ Australian Open match in February 2021, wearing a white graphic T-shirt with the words “Greatest Female Athlete” and a portrait of his wife.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Serena-Williams-3.jpg alt="Serena Williams" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Timeline of Alexis Ohanian and Serena Williams’ Relationship</h2><p>Ohanian and Williams apparently started dating shortly after meeting in 2015. Surprisingly, they ran into one other while arguing overAugust a table at a hotel in Rome where they were both staying. They stayed in touch after that, and the tennis champion subsequently asked the software entrepreneur to spend time with her in Paris in late 2015. They also didn’t spare any time in declaring their relationship and engagement. The pair revealed the good news in December 2016, when he proposed at the same hotel where they initially met. The couple then had their first kid, married, and are now a family of three.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiqnqqVo65uw8ilo6KZnah6orrDZpilnaiewG67x5qlopmeYrqivsqem2asmJp6p7vUq6uhZZGju6rCxKuqmqqpYrynedOhnKKqXaKus77Imp6eZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./robert-oneill-19760410-html.html><span>←</span><span>Robert O'Neill (War Hero) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</span></a>
