Katy, 37, spent some time with her daughter, <strong>Daisy Dove</strong>, in Beverly Hills, taking her and <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Orlando Bloom</a></strong>‘s daughter out for a few errands. Katy opted for a burgundy tracksuit — an<b>&nbsp;</b>activewear set from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-auth=NotApplicable data-safelink=true data-linkindex=0 data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Thrive Societe</a> — and a large burlap-colored fanny pack. Daisy, 1, wore a white outfit covered in black dots and rode on her mother’s hip while Katy walked around.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/katy-perry-daughter-daisy-park-backgrid-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>This playdate comes less than a week after Katy was <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>spotted</a> with Daisy <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>on another rare outing</a>. Just like this Monday excursion, Katy wore a maroon tracksuit, a baseball cap, and a pair of sunglasses while carrying her daughter on the July 25 trip to the park. Daisy wore a tan outfit, with her wild blonde locks flowing in the southern California weather.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Orlando, 45, and Katy have kept Daisy out of the spotlight since welcoming her in August 2020. They have yet to share a photo of her face publicly and have done their best to keep her out of the paparazzi’s lens. However, this hasn’t stopped Katy from raving about her tiny tot. “She loves ballet,” Katy told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>PEOPLE</a> while at the launch party for&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>De Soi,</a> the non-alcoholic beverage line that Perry co-founded. “She goes to tutu school, and she loves it. It’s all very adorable.” Katy added that she feels very “blessed” with motherhood. “You just never thought there was that capacity for love.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/katy-perry-daughter-daisy-park-backgrid-embed2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>In May, Katy <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>opened up about motherhood</a>. While on <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Chelsea Handler</strong></a>‘s&nbsp;podcast,&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Dear Chelsea</a>, Katy said she “wasn’t very maternal” before starting dating Bloom. But, she “got to see what a great dad he was with his first child, <strong>Flynn</strong>, who is now 11,” referring to Orlando’s son with ex-wife, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Miranda Kerr</strong></a>. “So that definitely, primally influenced me. Something inside of me said, ‘You, mid-30s. This man is nice. Must breed,'” she added.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Having a kid was “the best decision I made in my entire life,” says Katy. “Her happiness really gives me that joy. A lot of BS just falls away. Stuff that you thought was really important really was just never important. You don’t have time for any sort of energetic drama that’s not important in your family. Your family really starts to come first.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Katy will return to Las Vegas, resuming her Play residency at Resorts World until Aug. 13. From there, she has September off before playing the final dates in October.
