"She's a self-proclaimed Donna Martin with a hint of Kelly Taylor. And she's definitely Team Brandon [played by Jason Priestley]. She thinks he's adorable and loves his eyes!"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">These days, Spelling, who is also mom to Liam, 15, Hattie, 11, Finn, 10 and Beau, 5, with husband Dean McDermott, is back on TV as host of a new reality series, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>MTV's Love at First Lie</a>. On the show, eight couples try to uncover which of them are truly in love — and which couples are only pretending.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I was not prepared for everything that went down on this show," says Spelling. "There was a lot of love and a lot of tears. And in every episode there are new twists. I was like, 'No, I can't take any more!'"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Never miss a story — sign up for </strong><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow><strong>PEOPLE's free daily newsletter</strong></a><strong> to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.</strong></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Tori Spelling/Instagram</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The actress also reflects on the idea of misconceptions, something she's navigated nearly her entire career.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Whether you're in Hollywood or with someone face to face, people put a persona up and others can believe so much that isn't true," she says. "I feel like I'm definitely in the best place I've ever been for me personally. And it took so much work on my part."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Spelling says it's "freeing" to feel empowered enough to be her true self. "If you like me, you like me and if you don't, you don't. I know I can be polarizing but I'd rather people know the real me than think something that's not true."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And ultimately, hosting Love at First Lie proved to be uplifting for the star, in more ways than one.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We show so many different types of love and relationships," says Spelling. "I walked away from this show reinspired by love again."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Love at First Lie airs Wednesdays at 9:30/8:30C on MTV.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ6CWv6a606xmraeinnq0vMSlo6Kml2KxosHGoaueql2owaa4y5pkcmhiZn1ussCnZJ6wk6HCtLXVnmY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./people-pet-product-awards-2023-8413487.html><span>←</span><span>The Best New Pet Treats, Toys and Beds</span></a>
