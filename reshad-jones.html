As a result, some sources speculate that he intends to pursue a settled career in the real estate business.</p><h2>Reshad Jones | Career Stats</h2><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Year</strong></td><td><strong>GP</strong></td><td><strong>GS</strong></td><td><strong>Total</strong></td><td><strong>Solo</strong></td><td><strong>Ast</strong></td><td><strong>Sck</strong></td><td><strong>SFTY</strong></td><td><strong>PDef</strong></td><td><strong>Int</strong></td><td><strong>Yds</strong></td><td><strong>Lng</strong></td><td><strong>TDs</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Total</strong></td><td><strong>128</strong></td><td><strong>113</strong></td><td><strong>776</strong></td><td><strong>599</strong></td><td><strong>177</strong></td><td><strong>10.5</strong></td><td><strong>0</strong></td><td><strong>55</strong></td><td><strong>21</strong></td><td><strong>361</strong></td><td><strong>54</strong></td><td><strong>6</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Reshad Jones | Awards and titles</h2><p>Jones’s professional career in the NFL did not bring any titles at both individual as well as club levels.</p><p>Being selected in the 2010 NFL draft remained the biggest success for him.
