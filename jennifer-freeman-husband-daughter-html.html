She was introduced in the second season and played a prominent role&nbsp;in 110 episodes, with her last appearance being in the fifth season. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Her other acting credits include&nbsp;Beaus of Holly, True to the Game, You Got Served, Real Husbands of Hollywood, and Switched!</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Freeman's&nbsp;failed marriage with star&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>basketball player</a> Earl Watson&nbsp;also brought her to the spotlight. Her marriage, which lasted for around a year, made&nbsp;headlines for their long divorce battle, following an allegation made by Watson against the actress of&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">attacking him in a late-night rage</a>. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Marriage, Allegation, and Divorce</h2><p>On May 17, 2009, the two reportedly got married in a lavish ceremony at TV producer Ed Weinberger's Los Angeles mansion.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>The same year, on October 16, the former couple also welcomed their first daughter, Isabella Amour Watson. The actress was 23 years old.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Watson surprised everyone when he <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">filed legal papers</a> in Los Angeles over a year later,&nbsp;claiming his wife had violently attacked him during a late-night fight on August 1. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>He claimed he became&nbsp;suspicious after Freeman received a text message around 11 p.m. When he took her phone to check the message, an angry Freeman allegedly reacted by hitting him "forcefully twice in the face with her right open hand."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>The actress then allegedly grabbed the basketball pro's&nbsp;right wrist and bit down, "breaking the skin, leaving teeth marks and drawing blood." He also shared that once she let go of his wrist, she proceeded to bite down&nbsp;his chest.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>After the attack,&nbsp;Watson initially&nbsp;requested a divorce from Freeman, but he later&nbsp;withdrew his divorce petition with "plans to make their marriage work." However, the latter plan didn't go well either, as their growing difference led to their divorce in the next year. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Jennifer Freeman Is Presently Enjoying Her Career and Life with Daughter</h2><p>Post-divorce, Freeman focused on her career and appeared in a handful of television and film projects. Between 2010 and 2015, she appeared in notable projects like Falling Away and <a href=# rel=follow>Real Husbands of Hollywood</a>.</p><p>In the latter years, she has been doing modeling projects for various brands besides acting works.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Besides work, the actress is also&nbsp;co-parenting her daughter with her ex-husband Watson. Her daughter was about a year old when the couple separated. She recently&nbsp;turned 12 on October 2. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Freeman posted a series of pictures and TikTok videos of/with her daughter&nbsp;with a lengthy caption on her daughter's birthday.</p><p>"Happy 12th Birthday to my beautiful daughter Isabella Amora! You are full of joy and have the funniest personality. You bring sunshine wherever you go," she <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">wrote in the caption</a>.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>The actress seems to enjoy her career, working&nbsp;strength&nbsp;by strength, and achieving&nbsp;further happiness in her personal and professional life.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKKVo7uqssSrZJ%2BqlZq6orqMoaysmpGjsW6wwK6eoayVp3upwMyl</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sergio-brown.html><span>←</span><span>Fame | Sergio Brown net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</span></a>
