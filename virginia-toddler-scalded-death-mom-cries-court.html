That’s when Love and Hardee finally called authorities, as Harley’s condition worsened.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Virginia Police Department</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Body camera footage from the sergeant who responded to the call showed the child had “skin falling off her feet,” as the medics on the scene described it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As various parties testified and evidence was presented, Love sobbed audibly in the courtroom, WTKR reports.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The couple allegedly applied Vaseline and burn cream, among other remedies, to treat Harley’s wounds. During the hearing, a medical expert testified that if she had instead received proper medical care sooner, she likely would have survived.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b><i>• Want to keep up with the latest crime coverage? </i></b><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1><b><i>Click here</i></b></a><b><i> to get breaking crime news, ongoing trial coverage and details of intriguing unsolved cases in the True Crime Newsletter.</i></b></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to WTKR, Hardee pleaded guilty to child abuse in 2014 after he broke his own child’s skull and was therefore not allowed to be around children alone at the time of Harley’s burning.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">However, the station reports that evidence indicates Hardee was alone with her the night of the alleged abuse.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>RELATED VIDEO: Gypsy Rose Blanchard on Why SHe Didn’t Speak About Mom’s Abuse</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Love’s defense has reportedly argued that she was being abused by Hardee and didn’t know how dangerous he truly was.
