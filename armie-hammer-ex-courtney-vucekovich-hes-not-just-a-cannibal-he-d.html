also revealed a number of other kinks, some echoing Armie’s past statements about sex and sexuality.</p><p>He has dismissed these claims as total BS, but his former “acquaintance” (read: alleged mistress) is speaking out herself.</p><p>Once you cut through the sensational-sounding fantasies, it’s a story of a woman who describes manipulation and emotional abuse.</p><img

Vucekovich spoke to <a href=#>Page Six</a> this week in the wake of the alleged DMs surfacing on Instagram and TikTok.</p><p>“He said to me he wants to break my rib and barbecue and eat it,” she recalls.</p><p>“‘F–k that was weird,’ but you never think about it again.”</p><p>“He says, ‘I want to take a bite out of you.’ If I had a little cut on my hand, he’d like suck it or lick it,” Courtney describes.</p><p>“That’s about as weird as we got.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>“He likes the idea of skin in his teeth,” Courtney adds, though he … goes beyond that.</p><p>The bigger issue, she says, had little to do with his alleged kinks and fantasies.</p><p>“He enters your life in such a big way,” she explains. “He’s such a captivating person.”</p><p>Courtney continues: “He has such a presence and he’s aware of that and he uses it in such a way that most women would think, ‘Oh my gosh, this is amazing,’ but especially young women.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Courtney notes: “that’s kind of the scary part — how good he is at active manipulation and making you feel like he’s never felt this way about anybody.”</p><p>She describes how Armie’s overpowering presence, his charm, and his charisma led to her submitting to him on both a physical and emotional level.</p><p>Over time, however, Courtney came to believe that she was being both manipulated and gaslit.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“He quickly grooms you in the relationship,” Courtney describes.</p><p>“He kind of captivates you and while being charming, he’s grooming you for these things that are darker and heavier and consuming,” she says.</p><p>“When I say consuming, I mean mentally, physically, emotionally, financially, just everything,” Courtney clarifies.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Courtney describes Armie as a “chameleon” who becomes “exactly who you need him to be” as a manipulation tactic.</p><p>“He sucks out all the goodness you have left,” she laments.</p><p>“That’s what he did to me,” Courtney recalls. “I gave and gave and gave until it hurt.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Courtney describes Armie’s behavior as eventually turning “obsessive,” citing a time when the two were side-by-side for three weeks without a break.</p><p>Even when they were physically separated, she adds that he would text her as often as 100 times per day.</p><p>“I wasn’t safe,” Courtney says that she eventually realized.</p><p>“He kind of makes it like, ‘I’m going to teach you things.'”</p><p>“I’m smarter than that,” Courtney affirms, “but where was I during that? I knew the whole time.”</p><p>“I had this gut feeling the whole time that this was not right. He’s not well,” she expresses.</p><p>She adds that Armie would allegedly drink and do drugs “all the time,” which made her feel unsafe and afraid.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>“He did some things with me that I wasn’t comfortable with,” Courtney shares.</p><p>She recalls: “For God knows what reason, he convinced me that these things were OK and he put me in some dangerous situations where I was not OK.”</p><p>Courtney says that these were situations “where he was heavily drinking, and I wasn’t drinking that way and it scared me. I didn’t feel comfortable.”</p><p>“You end up doing things that are very out-of-character for you, including sex acts,” Courtney admits.</p><p>She of course did not go into detail, noting how easily the (honestly mostly pretty mild) BDSM roleplay in the alleged DMs threatens to overshadow the important conversations.</p><p>Courtney says that Armie is one of the “most broken” people whom she has ever encountered … which seems to be part of his routine.</p><p>“He makes you feel bad for him, and that’s really scary and keeps you [close to him],” Courtney characterizes.</p><p>She reveals that she at one point found herself paying for everything — even the gas in his truck — after the millionaire heir and actor claimed to be broke.</p><p>“He needs you,” Courtney says. “He actually needs you. It’s a full-time job when you’re with him the way that I was.”</p><p>“I was trying to catch my breath the entire time I was with him,” Courtney explains. “You’re drowning in this dark hole trying to stay afloat.”</p><p>She explains: “There will be random moments of good that convince you to stay.”</p><p>Courtney says that it only ended after an explosive fight.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“He blows up [women’s] lives like that and walks away,” Courtney characterizes.</p><p>After, she describes, she experienced panic attacks over the toxic relationship, even checking herself into a 30-day partial hospitalization to address her trauma and PTSD.</p><p>“I didn’t want to carry that into my future,” she says. “As a strong mental health advocate, I knew that this relationship was something I needed to process with help from people who specialize in trauma and PTSD. That is my experience.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“Therapy is really helpful after healing from any kind of abuse,” Courtney concludes. “You don’t want to take that trauma with you.”</p><p>It is easy for us all to be caught up in the “kinky” elements of the alleged DMs — with the BDSM roleplay and Armie’s reported fondness for anal sex matching up with his past interviews and social media “likes.”</p><p>But ultimately, what Courtney is describing is much more serious than someone with a vore fetish.</p><p>No relationship should leave a person traumatized.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Hammer and wife Elizabeth Chambers split last year after 10 years of marriage.</p><p>In recent days, <a href=#>Hammer has denied being a cannibal</a>, calling these allegations “BS”, but dropped out of his most recent film project with Jennifer Lopez.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2tpX2V%2BcK3RpqCeZZiWuq6x0WacsWWTpMKzwM2esGaupZiyrLvVopqhZZiawG66zq1ko62jqXqiecKapaehkpa5brTEZpto</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./brittany-cartwright-anf-jax-taylor-actually-engaged.html><span>←</span><span>Brittany Cartwright and Jax Taylor: Actually Engaged!!!!!</span></a>
