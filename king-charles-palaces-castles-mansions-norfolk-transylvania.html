The new King has his pick of the bunch and could live anywhere, with some estates not even being UK-based.
However, choosing to relocate could see him overstretched alongside his new role and duties, claims a Royal source."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

It’s not his style.</p><p>"He may decide that it should be available to the public all year round.”</p><h2>Clarence House</h2><p>Clarence House is much smaller and more personal.</p><p>Hugo Vickers, a royal historian and author, said Charles would run his office out of Buckingham Palace and use it for state occasions - but that's it.</p><p>Mr Vickers claimed the King has no yearning to live there, just like the late <a href=#>Queen</a> didn't,</p><p>He said: "I think you’ll find that he’ll stay at Clarence House, which even [Queen Elizabeth] wanted to do, but Winston Churchill made her go to Buckingham Palace."</p><p>Charles has lived there since 2003 with Camilla, says <a href=#>Samuel Mee</a> from the Antique Ring Boutique and a royal expert.</p><h2>Balmoral</h2><p>There are two properties in Balmoral which Charles could choose to live in as he carries out his reign.</p><p>There is Birkhall at Balmoral Estate and Balmoral Castle.</p><p>According to the Sunday Times, a royal source with knowledge of royal residences in Scotland said Charles preferred Birkhall rather than the Castle.</p><p>Birkhall is a smaller affair with only eight bedrooms whereas the Castle has 52.</p><p>The source said. “He absolutely loves Birkhall. I would be amazed if he abandoned that.</p><p>"I think it’s far more likely that he will stay at Balmoral when there are prime ministerial visits but treat it like an office, as he does with Buckingham Palace.”</p><p>Sam Mee says Birkhall is what the royal couple think of as their marital home. Charles inherited it in 2002 from the Queen Mother, and it's where they honeymooned three years later.</p><h2>Fort Belvedere</h2><p>Fort Belvedere, Windsor, is a Grade II listed building built with a gothic style.</p><p>Whilst owned by the Royal Family, it is rented out privately.</p><p>It has been used by the same family since the 1980s so isn't likely to become Charles' main home.</p><h2>Zalan Castle</h2><p>Zalan Castle in Transylvania is owned by the King, who reportedly has links to the prince who inspired the Dracula story.</p><p>Also known as the Zalan Guesthouse, the property is now a holiday let visited by tourists each year.</p><p>Proceeds of any bookings then go to The Prince of Wales Foundation in Romania.</p><h2>Castle of Mey</h2><p>Castle of Mey on the north coast of Scotland is owned by one of the charity trusts the King is president of.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Charles spends much of his summer months at the Scottish castle which is open to the public when he's not staying there.</p><p>This year, it is closed between July 29 and August 9 which reveals when the King is planning on visiting.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/arr9wt-birkhall-house-royal-residence-817639100.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/balmoral-castle-summer-residence-british-811203893.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/taken-online-blog-https-scenetherapy-723590976.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jp%2BYm62cpMK0e5Fram5vZ2WFcLfIp55mm5iWv62x0manmqSRmLK0ecKaqq2klah6rq3NrKCopqNiu7C%2BxaijpGWkp66vv9ilrZqmmZZ8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./general-hospital-lexi-ainsworth-slammed-show-recast-kristina.html><span>←</span><span>General Hospital star Lexi Ainsworth blasts show for recasting her role of Kristina ahead of very</span></a>
