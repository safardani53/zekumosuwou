The basketball brothers, Cameron and Puff, come from an athletic family.</strong></p><p>It is in their DNA to play basketball. Their parents Amy, and Gilbert Johnson, are former collegiate basketball players, that too good ones in their heyday.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/cameron-johnson-fiba-world-cup.jpg><p>Their older brother, Aaron Johnson, is also a former basketball player, and their youngest brother, Braylon Johnson, will soon join them on the bigger stage as he completes his senior year of high school.</p><p>The first-round pick of the 2019 Draft, Cameron Johnson, was traded to Brooklyn Nets earlier this year. But it was not only Johnson who moved to Brooklyn but also his close friend <a href=# rel=noopener>Mikal Bridges</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The two Brooklyn Nets players are currently playing for Team USA in the 2023 FIBA World Cup and are hopefully bringing home the gold.&nbsp;</p><h2>Cameron Johnson Brother: The Johnson Quartet</h2><p>Cameron Johnson’s younger brother, Donovan Johnson, made a name for himself as a collegiate player with the Tar Heels. The two basketball players have two other brothers.&nbsp;</p><p>Their oldest Johnson brother, Aaron Johnson, is a former basketball player. He graduated from Moon Area High School and later enrolled in Clarion University.&nbsp;</p><p>During his time at Moon Area High School, Aaron became the all-time school leader in scoring with 1,626 points. He was the school valedictorian and also received National Merit Award.&nbsp;</p><p>But in Clarion, Aaron had limited success and didn’t persuade the sport professionally like his brother.&nbsp;</p><h3>Donovan “Puff” Johnson Plays For Penn State&nbsp;</h3><p>The second youngest brother, Donovan “Puff” Johnson, has an age gap of four years with his brother Cameron Johnson.&nbsp;</p><p>The 6’8 small forward Donovan “Puff” Johnson received his nickname “Puff” from his mother, Amy Johnson because he liked the cereal Cocoa Puffs.&nbsp;</p><p>Donovan spent three years with Moon Area High School before graduating from Hillcrest Prep in his senior year. At Moon, Donovan was a two-time all-state and three-time all-section honoree.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/cameron-johnson-brother-puff-johnson.jpg><p>Donovan averaged 22.1 points, 9.4 rebounds, and 1.2 blocks per game before he joined Hillcrest. In his senior year with Hillcrest, Donovan averaged 14.4 points, 8.2 rebounds, and 2.6 assists per game.</p><p>Puff enrolled at The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 2020 and didn’t have the best start. He was injured for most of his freshman year. Donovan mostly contributed to his squad in his junior season.</p><p>He would start as one of the main rotation players and appeared in 27 of 33 games. He averaged 4.1 points and 2.7 rebounds. For his senior season, Donovan joined Penn State.&nbsp;</p><p>Their youngest brother, Braylon Johnson, is a senior at Pinnacle High School. Earlier this year, Cameron Johnson showed up at his brother’s basketball event&nbsp;at Millennium High School.&nbsp;</p><h2>Cameron Johnson Parents, Amy, And Gilbert Johnson&nbsp;</h2><p>Cameron Johnson’s parents Amy, and Gilbert Johnson, are former collegiate basketball players.&nbsp;</p><p>The small forward’s mother, Amy Johnson, played for Kent State from 1982-1986 and became their 19th all-time scorer with 1,018 points. The mother of four boys is a nurse at Our Lady of The Sacred Heart, Cameron’s high school.</p><p>When Cameron reached the NBA Finals in 2021, the sisters of Our Lady of The Sacred Heart said they only followed the Suns because of Cameron. They further stated that they take regular updates about the NBA player from his mom.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/cameron-johnson-parents.jpg><p>In 2020, Cameron, with his parents and siblings, gave back to the Moon Area School District community before he headed for the NBA Bubble. Johnson wrapped up 12 dozen bags of Chick-Fil-A chicken sandwiches and nuggets, bottled water, and bags of chips.&nbsp;</p><p>The Nets’ player spent three hours handing lunch to the people in need. His father, Gilbert Johnson, played for the University of Pittsburgh from 1988-90. He joined Pitts from Lees-McRae Junior College.&nbsp;</p><p>In an interview with The Athletic in 2019, Gilbert was full of praise for his wife, Amy, and said she was better at sports than him. Amy played the multi-positional game, similar to today’s playing style.</p><p>This drew the comment from Gilbert that she was ahead of her time. He further stated that Amy plays tennis two-on-one against her oldest son and his girlfriend and beats them.&nbsp;</p><p>The husband-wife duo coached their sons relentlessly, leading up to seeing one of their sons become a first-round pick in the NBA Draft.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmionJbGpr7Sm6CoZpOkunCvwKacq6eeYrewtM2spqdlkqe8tbTEq2SamaKku26wzqemr5meYq%2BzrdilpqdloJa%2FprrTrGY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-gerry-turner-5135368.html><span>←</span><span>Who Is Gerry Turner?
