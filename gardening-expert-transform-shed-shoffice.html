class=has-text-align-center>Paint it</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/paint-shed-809229309.jpg><p>WHETHER you’re aiming for a bright and cheery beach hut vibe, or a swathe of subtle greens so your shed blends in with your backdrop, painting is a great way to start transforming it into something special.</p><p>Amazon and most DIY shops sell cheap spray-paint, especially for wood, and try Johnstone’s Garden Colours, £12.</p><p>Bright pops of colour will add excitement and vibrancy to your garden, while more subtle shades will help to keep it tranquil and calm – so think about what you’re going to use the shed for and how you want it to feel.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Waterproof it</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/waterproof-repeller-5litres-19-99-809231713.jpg><p>ONCE you’ve chosen your final colour, slather on a layer of see-through waterproof repeller to ensure it holds up against the unpredictable British winter.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Fabulous</h2></p><p>There’s no point in creating a cosy garden hideaway that will end up dimpled with dampness.</p><p><a href=#>Screwfix</a> sells five litres for £19.99.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Light it</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/s-place-dump-rusty-lawnmowers-809042008.jpg><p>SOLAR lights for the inside and out are a must, to add class, colour and clarity, and there are so many out there to suit every budget.</p><p><a href=#>B&M</a> has a huge range, like this £10 lantern (above), and they stay bright into the night.</p><p>Just make sure the solar panel is in the sun – it can be tucked away on the roof to keep it out of the way, and it’s best to look for ones with timers, so you’re not scrabbling around with switches.</p><p>While festoon lights work best for the outside, there’s a host of lantern-style lights that can work inside, as long as they’re placed near a window.</p><p>And if you’ve managed to connect your shed to the mains electricity, or even have a hidden extension lead, places such as <a href=#>Wilko</a>, Homebase or <a href=#>B&Q</a> have loads of reasonably priced fairy lights.</p><p>String them across the inside of your ceiling to bring a touch of magic to your space.</p><p>You can even go battery-powered, to save on bills.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Hang curtains</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/small-pine-wooden-garden-shed-809233564.jpg><p>MAKE your shed more homely with some makeshift curtains.</p><p>A piece of cord or curtain wire nailed in at both ends of the window with some brightly coloured offcuts or old curtains you may have lying around will look quirky and do just as well as proper drapes.</p><p>Simply sew the top over and loop the cord through.</p><p>And curtains will keep the warmth in as well as giving a welcome splash of colour.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Brighten windows</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

and sparkle to the room.</p><p>Because sheds tend to be darker than rooms in our homes, <a href=#>keeping the glass clean</a> is extra ­important.</p><p>You can make an all-natural and cheap window-cleaning solution from equal parts of white vinegar and hot water to give them an extra shine.</p><p>Adding a plastic skylight can give even more light, but that can be costly and needs a professional to fit it.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Lay a rug</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

£9.99.</p><p>Not quite robust enough to keep out in your garden all year round, but they’re perfect for your shed floor, and because they are so cheap you won’t feel too horrified about cutting them to fit if necessary.</p><p>A rug can anchor a room, define it, add warmth, and help to layer a room’s decor.</p><p>And they also keep it soft enough for slippers. Winner.</p><p>Pick up this 60x110cm micro plush rug (above) for £9.99 at B&M.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Soften the edges</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/60265c05-23b8-4a72-b65b-a3e79b96c2ac.jpg><p>INDOOR and outdoor cushions are also all the rage this year.</p><p>Dunelm, B&M and Habitat have some fabulous bright, budget-friendly ones in store now.</p><p>Whether they’re giant ones to sit on, or just support for your back while you work, there are ones for every occasion.</p><p>And Wilko has a range of comfy throws for cuddling up in the cooler summer evenings.</p><p>Try the tropical print shower-resistant cushion for £10 at B&M or this Wilko ochre supersoft throw (above) for just £3.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Smart storage</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/www-shein-co-uk-10pcs-809232253.jpg><p>LESS is more in a small shed.</p><p>But there’s no reason why you can’t add an extra bit of storage.</p><p>Sturdy shelves are a must, but make sure you attach them to some sort of support to keep them strong.</p><p>Try arranging cushions on a strong storage box to turn it into a seat.</p><p>Hooks are good, get this metal wall hook and shelf (above) for £1.75 from Shein.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Tile the floor</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/s-place-dump-rusty-lawnmowers-809041967.jpg><p>COMBINED with plain white walls inside, tiling will give you a chic and modern Mediterranean vibe, so you will feel like you’re on holiday, even if you’re just in your garden.</p><p>Paler shades will also make it feel bigger.</p><p>These starry ones from Tile Mountain (above) are only just over a fiver per tile, and you wouldn’t need many to fill a shed.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Mirror mirror</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/hanging-chain-square-wall-mirror-809232539.jpg><p>A SHED is too small for a picture wall, but a couple of carefully placed frames won’t go amiss.</p><p>And a strategically positioned mirror – this one from Dunelm (above) is £6 – will make it feel bigger.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Add flower power</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/c32be6bb-7bb6-4e40-8a67-53e2de53b23f.jpg><p>WINDOW boxes and trellis troughs are the perfect way to add natural colour and grace to a garden shed, and they work as a perfect camouflage.</p><p>Plant fast-growing climbers such as clematis, rambling roses and honeysuckle in the troughs to cover your space in scented heaven.</p><p>And use window boxes and hanging baskets to fill with annual flowers.</p><p><a href=#>Lidl</a> does a great range of plants all summer and you can pick and choose the colour scheme to suit your mood.</p><p>Its garden event started on Thursday.</p><p>At the moment it has clematis and honeysuckle on sale for £6.99.</p><p>And always remember that houseplants will bring the outside in – even on the rainiest day.</p><p>Why not try this Prosperplast Boardee flower box (above), now £8.27 at Amazon.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Furnish it</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/s-place-dump-rusty-lawnmowers-809041982.jpg><p>THERE are so many looks you can choose to fill the inside.</p><p>Whether it’s a minimal Scandi or floral flounce, laid back and relaxed, or straightforward office, Ikea is usually the best go-to budget-friendly option.</p><p>Bean bags like this one can be bought (unfilled) from Amazon for £6.29 and they offer a slouchy, summery feel.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>And head to Aldi for its White Company candle dupes.</p><p>Its Lime, Basil & Mandarin candle is £3.49 and will add a sweet touch to your space while creating a soothing ambience.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jp%2BYm62cpMK0e5FrZ2lxYWmDcLPAq5ueppmjtG6x16mcq6xdqb%2BiutKfpqulXai1prCMrJ%2BonpaesKZ7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bella-hadid-pink-lingerie-victorias-secret-valentines-day-photos.html><span>←</span><span>Bella Hadid Pink Lingerie For Victorias Secret Valentines Day Photos Hollywood Life</span></a>
