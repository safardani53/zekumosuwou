<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>Marcel Kidnaps Hayley Season 1 Episode 6 Recap Hollywood Life</h1></header><section class=post-content><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/the-originals-106-featured.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-2>In a nutshell, Elijah (<strong>Daniel Gillies</strong>) was able to coax Davina (<strong>Danielle Campbell</strong>) — without her knowing, of course — into breaking Sophie’s bond, and not a moment too soon! That trick Agnes injected Sophie with a blood pressure-raising syrum that nearly overcooked Hayley’s hybrid bun, but thankfully, both mom and baby will live to see another day. Mom also got to share a sexy pool scene with daddy’s brother… but I’ll get to that later.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>As a thank-you for effing with his family line, Elijah snapped Agnes’ treacherous little neck, leaving her lifeless body on the church floor for all to see. This certainly won’t sit well with Sophie, who now stands to lose her powers for good, considering Agnes was the only witch powerful enough to complete the Harvest/Reaping ceremony.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Of course, this crisis pales in comparison to the one faced by the Mikaelsons now, as Marcel finally tracked down Klaus’ (<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Joseph Morgan</strong></a>)&nbsp;headquarters — and kidnapped Hayley!</p><h3>Elijah & Hayley: A Ship Sets Sail</h3><p id=content-paragraph-5>This episode was dripping with Hayley-Elijah tension… and I loved every minute of it. From their first interaction in the kitchen — milk has never seemed so sexy, am I right? — to the eventual pool scene, which totally channeled&nbsp;<strong>Baz Luhrmann</strong>‘s&nbsp;Romeo + Juliet, I was practically screaming at the TV for Elijah to kiss his brother’s baby mama. (And by “practically,” I mean “literally.”)<strong><br></strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Sadly, the hookup was not to be — at least, not now. But what was Elijah going to do, make out with Hayley in front of Rebecca and Sophie? I’m fairly confident a kiss will happen eventually, and like all good things, I’m willing to wait.</p><h3>Marcel & Rebekah’s Love Lust Games</h3><p id=content-paragraph-7>Speaking of sexual chemistry, holy crap! Could that Rebekah-Marcel scene have been any hotter?! I knew the couple had a history, but now I’m more interested in its future. Even if sex with Marcel wasn’t enough to get Rebekah to stay in New Orleans — let’s just say their latest romp didn’t have a ‘happy ending’ — I’m pretty confident that, like Elijah and Hayley, this flame is&nbsp;far&nbsp;from extinguished.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Marcel was even kind (read: douchey) enough to give Klaus permission to pursue Cami, as he’s decided that he’s officially done playing with her. It’s funny how Marcel can go from being a perfect gentleman one minute to being a total d-bag the next. But hey, that’s vampires for ya!</p><h3>Further Cam-plications</h3><p id=content-paragraph-9>And then, as always, there’s Cami (<strong>Leah Pipes</strong>). The show’s token human finally found out that Agnes was responsible for her brother’s massacre, but was furious with Klaus for letting Elijah kill her. After vowing to undo Klaus’ compulsion, she told him he’d soon wish he never met her.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>So… I guess I can throw out my ‘Team Claumi’ t-shirt. And just when I was&nbsp;really&nbsp;starting to like them together!</p><p id=content-paragraph-11><strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>, what did you think of this week’s episode? Are you worried about Hayley? Do you want her with Elijah? And how do you feel about Cami and Klaus?
