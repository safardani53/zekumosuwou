However, it is known that his parents are incredibly supportive of him.&nbsp;</p><p>For instance, once, Will <a href=#>shared a clip</a> of his parents watching his wrestling match on TV. After seeing Will wrestle and win the game, his father remarked, “Fuck me, son, you’ve been working out.”</p><p>Will’s parents hold a special place in his heart?

The wrestler said Frontline would be a British Puroresu-style organization that aspires to restore wrestling’s status as a sport in England.</p><p>They held their inaugural event, “Build Me An Empire,” on June 28, 2018. When wrestlers decide to promote themselves, it usually happens after retirement when they seek new opportunities to give back to the industry.</p><p>Ospreay’s advancement was just temporary. Will, however, sold Frontline on the promotion’s first anniversary. He did so to relocate to Japan and pursue a full-time schedule with New Japan Pro Wrestling.</p><p>However, his involvement in the activity in the first place demonstrates his interest in the industry.</p><h3><span id=All_Elite_Wrestling_(2022–present) class=mw-headline>All Elite Wrestling</span></h3><p>Will made his unexpected debut for the All Elite Wrestling on June 8, 2022, episode of AEW Dynamite. The wrestler attacked Trent Beretta and FTR with stablemates Aaron Henare, Kyle Fletcher, and Mark Davis of Aussie Open.</p><p>This came two weeks after United Empire teammates Great-O-Khan and Jeff Cobb made their debuts on AEW Dynamite by attacking Roppongi Vice and FTR.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Will-Ospreay-with-Kyle-Fletcher-and-Mark-Davis.jpg><p>Beretta and FTR defeated Davis and Fletcher of the Aussie Open and Will of the United Empire on June 10, 2022’s AEW Rampage.</p><p>Will defeated Dax Harwood in his debut singles match on the special Road Rager Dynamite edition that aired on June 15.&nbsp;</p><p>After the match, Will and United Empire stablemates attacked FTR and Roppongi Vice again, interrupted by Orange Cassidy, who stared down Ospreay.</p><p>Soon after, a singles match between men was scheduled for AEW×NJPW: Forbidden Door, for Ospreay’s newly won IWGP United States Heavyweight Championship.</p><p>At AEW×NJPW: Forbidden Door, the wrestler successfully defended the IWGP US Heavyweight Title against Orange Cassidy.</p><p>After the match, Ospreay and Aussie Open attacked Cassidy and Roppongi Vice, only to be stopped by Katsuyori Shibata, who shot the trio.&nbsp;</p><h2><span id=Professional_wrestling_style_and_persona class=mw-headline>Will Ospreay | Twitter feuds</span></h2><h3>Feud with Vader</h3><p>One of the most brutal wrestlers in history, <strong>Vader</strong> is a legend in the world of professional wrestling. This is one of the reasons he didn’t enjoy Will Ospreay and Ricochet’s well-known 2016 match.</p><p>The two of them ultimately got into a heated public debate on Twitter that garnered some attention. The two of them, however, capitalized on their falling out and had a match.</p><p><a href=#>Click here to know about<strong> Mya Lynn Lesnar, daughter of Brock Lesnar,</strong> who shares the same traits as her father!</a></p><h3>Feud with Rollins</h3><p>Will Ospreay has encountered problems on social media not just with Vader but with other well-known wrestlers as well. The wrestler once emphasized his survival in response to <strong>Seth Rollins’</strong> assertion that WWE offered the most OK wrestling in the industry.</p><p>Things quickly got out of hand, and Rollins eventually demanded that Ospreay looks at his bank account as evidence.</p><p>Rollins’ attitude was not well received by WWE fans, who let him know. Rollins expressed regret to Ospreay for his remarks more than a week later.</p><p>Will continued by accepting the apologies and expressing his appreciation for Rollins, who he had watched since he was Tyler Black. The two then resolved, with neither party continuing the debate.</p><h3>Feud with Pollyanna</h3><p>Will was charged with blocking Pollyanna, a former wrestler, as part of the Speaking Out campaign. Pollyanna made accusations against Ospreay’s friend and fellow Swords of Essex teammate Scott Wainwright.</p><p>International Wrestling League (IWL), an independent wrestling organization, said on Twitter that a venue asked them to remove Pollyanna from an event at Ospreay’s request.</p><p>IWL later revealed that the venue had asked to have her removed rather than Ospreay. Later, the IWL Twitter user admitted that the purported proof was their perspective on an “unclear situation.”</p><h2>Will Ospreay | Girlfriend</h2><p>Will Ospreay was in a relationship with Bea Priestley since 2017.
