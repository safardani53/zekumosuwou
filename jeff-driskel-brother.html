His mother, Mary, served in the U.S. coast guard for many years.&nbsp;</p><p>Jerry had joined the navy when he was just seventeen. He traveled to different places worldwide, serving his country, and eventually retired after twenty years of service.</p><p>Being the children of military personnel, Jason and his brother grew up in a disciplined environment. They spent about three years of their childhood in Sasebo when Jerry was posted in Japan.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/The-Driskel-brothers-in-their-childhood.jpg><p>Jason began playing baseball and football at a young age. His elder brother, Jeff, was a comparatively better baseball player than him, but he was not that far behind.</p><p>While in Japan, their parents had admitted them to a Little League team, where they became local superstars because of their performances, as the other teammates lacked as much athleticism as the Driskel brothers had.</p><p>After returning to the U.S., Jason attended Hagerty High School in Oviedo, Florida, where he played football. Aside from being good at sports, Jason was academically gifted and always brought excellent grades.</p><p>After graduation, he enrolled in the Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton. He graduated with a degree in civil engineering from the university in May 2018.</p><p><strong>You Might Want to Read <a href=#>Kyle Fuller Brother: All About Fuller Brothers!</a></strong></p><h2>Jeff Driskel Brother | Career</h2><h3>Football Career</h3><p>An incredibly talented athlete since his teenage years, Jeff Driskel played exceptionally well for the Hagerty High School team until 2014.

In addition, Jason made it clear that he had never thought of having a professional football career ever in his life.</p><h3>Beyond Football</h3><p>After graduating college, Jason worked in various positions for different companies, mainly Restaurant Brands International and GoPuff.&nbsp;</p><p>Restaurant Brands International is a fast-food chain with branches across various nations.
