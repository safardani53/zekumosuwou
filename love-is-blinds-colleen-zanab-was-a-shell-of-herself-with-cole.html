<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>Love Is Blind's Colleen: Zanab Was a Shell of Herself With Cole</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>A tough situation. <a href=#>Love is Blind</a> star <a href=#><strong>Colleen Reed</strong></a> opened up about watching the way costar <a href=#><strong>Zanab Jaffrey</strong></a>‘s relationship with <a href=#><strong>Cole Barnett</strong></a> took a toll on her self-esteem.</p><p>“It’s so hard, but I saw the transition that happened from the Zanab that we met in the pods to the <a href=#>Zanab that we saw toward the end of the experience</a>,” the PR strategist, 26, exclusively told Us Weekly during a joint interview with husband <strong>Matt Bolton</strong> on Wednesday, November 16. “She definitely became a shell of a human being.”</p><p>Colleen added that she first noticed tension between the pair during the group’s post-engagement trip to Malibu, after Cole, 27, <a href=#>confessed that he was more attracted to her than to his then-fiancée</a>. “Whether she asked about it or not, he still said that she was a nine out of a 10 and two other women were 10 out of tens,” the ballerina explained. “Those comments do get to you. And if that was said to me constantly, <a href=#>I would definitely get in my head and I would pick apart situations</a> that might not have been a big deal [to other people], but a big deal to [me].”</p><p>She continued: “[Cole] is not a bad human being by any means. I don’t think he’s evil or anything like that. I just think that he can sometimes … <a href=#>he’s not careful with his words and his behaviors</a>. And I think it really got to her.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Love-Is-Blinds-Colleen-Zanab-Was-Shell-Herself-While-Dating-Cole-0001.jpg><p>The most controversial example of Cole’s comments hurting Zanab came to light during the season 3 reunion when the London native <a href=#>claimed that her former fiancé frequently body-shamed her</a>. “I stopped eating. I was eating, like, a banana and a scoop of peanut butter so I wouldn’t pass out on the long days we were filming,” Zanab alleged during the November 9 episode, adding that it was his “saving grace” that most of the footage ended up on the cutting room floor.</p><p>“The pushing food away from me, the asking me if I’m going to eat that, trying to get me to order a salad, <a href=#>the daily comments about my face and my body were not used</a>,” she continued. “And that’s great because it really did protect you and you are now denying it and calling me a liar in front of all these people.”</p><p>After several references to the “cuties incident,” Love is Blind producers aired a deleted scene of <a href=#>Cole asking Zanab if she was going to eat two clementines</a> ahead of their dinner reservation.</p><p>“That’s a serving, are you OK with that?” she responded, to which the former youth pastor encouraged her to “save your [appetite]” for their night out. “I’m talking, [big] supper tonight. … Are you getting wedding dress bod?”</p><p>Colleen told Us that her initial reaction when she saw that argument was to wonder if Zanab was OK — particularly after <a href=#>the moment became a topic of debate amongst Love is Blind fans online</a>.</p><p>“I saw the public reaction and [she is the] last person that deserves this [animosity] because people are just ruthless,” she explained. “And she really went through a hard time mentally and physically during this whole process. So my initial reaction was making sure that she was OK.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Though she emphasized that none of the women from the show wanted to “choose sides,” Colleen revealed that <a href=#>they were all doing their best to support Zanab</a> amid the public backlash. “She’s fine [now]. She’s killing it,” she explained. “But we just wanna make sure that she’s okay because she was a shell of a human being by the end of this. And now we have this public reaction saying horrible things [about her].”</p><p>With reporting by Christina Garibaldi</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKOorpVitrR5waWgp5yjYrCwuMuenKdlqpa7oq6MsJisZZFiwKmxy6VkqJ5dnbKzv8SlnWavmam1bq%2FOpZxo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./annalu-cardoso-the-hottest-pics-of-tygas-sidepiece.html><span>←</span><span>Annalu Cardoso: The Hottest Pics of Tyga's Sidepiece!</span></a>
