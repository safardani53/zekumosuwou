Believe it or not, it isn’t over marijuana use. He didn’t use any illegal substance.</p><p>Take a look at the photo that he uploaded to his own Instagram:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>According to the USADA, this just-for-fun IV of vitamins is a policy violation.</p><p>"On May 24, 2018, Lochte, 33, posted an image on social media depicting himself receiving an intravenous infusion."</p><p>Folks with a fear of needles must be shaking their heads at the idea of a man being hooked up to an IV without any medical need.</p><p>"A subsequent investigation by USADA," the report reads. "With which Lochte fully cooperated …"</p><p>The investigation "revealed that Lochte received an intravenous infusion of permitted substances at an infusion clinic."</p><p>Unfortunately, thought he substances were permitted, he received them "in a volume greater than 100 mL in a 12-hour period without a Therapeutic Use Exemption (TUE)."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Whoops.</p><p>"Intravenous infusions or injections in a volume greater than 100 mL within a 12-hour period are prohibited at all times," the USADA explains.</p><p>So you can’t get pumped full of anything, apparently.</p><p>He wasn’t getting some kind of supersoldier serum — he was getting what sounds like a vitamin-laced placebo.</p><p>This policy isn’t unreasonable, as they say "except for those legitimately received in the course of hospital treatment, surgical procedures, or clinical diagnostic investigations under the USADA Protocol."</p><p>In other words, actual medical needs won’t disqualify you.</p><p>Getting an injection for funsies, on the other hand, and you’re looking at 14 months out of the pool.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Lochte’s estimated net worth is $6.2 million, build out of endorsement deals based upon his Olympic record and, of course, his famous goofy persona.</p><p>So the good news is that he won’t spend the next 14 months working odd jobs or crashing on a friend’s couch, as most people might if they found themselves forbidden from their profession for over a year.</p><p>The bad news is that this is still an embarrassment for him, personally.</p><p>He’s also a father now — his son just turned one year old last month.</p><p>He’s going to need to supplement his small fortune over time in order to plan for his family’s future.</p><p>That means that he needs to retain his career as a swimmer in order to get future endorsements. This puts his role in the 2020 Olympics in jeopardy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>When some little beast decided to record Michael Phelps taking a hit off of a bong and share that video with the world, it didn’t hurt Phelps’ brand because, well, only Jeff Sessions cares about pot.</p><p>This incident is similarly unlikely to hurt Lochte’s reputation.</p><p>Why? Because his reputation is mostly that he’s a loveable idiot.</p><p>This little suspension is exactly something that you’d expect from him — at least, if you’re familiar with USADA rules.</p><p>Clearly, Lochte was not familiar with those regulations. But now he is.</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>16 Things Ryan Lochte Definitely Would Do</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pwX2WEcL7YmqVmpJ%2BYtbWxjKCpmqWjYrWqv4yorqdloqq5pnnBq5yao5mjtG6zxK2qZmlkYrqwutOhZJ2noJ67qHnSrqpo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./prince-harry-flirts-with-pussycat-dolls-ashley-roberts-parties-with-princess-beatrice-and-made-in-chelsea-cast-2013162.html><span>←</span><span>Prince Harry Flirts With a Pussycat Doll, Parties With Reality Stars</span></a>
