For the second week in a row, <i><a href=#>Teen Mom OG</a></i> featured a story line all about how <a href=#><b>Farrah Abraham</b></a> can never get along with her mother. <b><a href=#>Maci Bookout</a></b>, on the other hand, did a great job of getting along with someone she hasn’t always seen eye-to-eye with.</p><p><b>Catelynn Plays House</b></p><p>On the Monday, November 21, episode, Maci sent <a href=#><b>Catelynn Lowell</b></a> and <b>Tyler Baltierra</b> an invitation to her wedding, giving them something fun to focus on other than the repairs they needed to get done before they could move into their new house.</p><p>The two of them debated about the amount they were willing to go over budget to fix some of the issues, like the buckling floor. Tyler was especially concerned about moving forward with the new house after his mom told him she was worried about his depression. She advised him to finish up the home so he’d have something to feel good about, which weighed on his mind as he decided how much to pay to get into the house quicker.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p><b>Maci Plays Nice</b></p><p>Maci’s fiancé, <b>Taylor McKinney</b>, took her 7-year-old, Bentley, to get his tux for the wedding! Meanwhile, Maci considered inviting Bentley’s dad, <b>Ryan Edwards</b>, over to her house so she could meet his new girlfriend before the big day, to which the couple was invited. Mackenzie was excited that she was invited to hang out, saying she wanted everyone to get along.</p><p>“I hope it’s not awkward,” Maci mused as she got ready for the dinner a few days later. Luckily, the meet-up went great, and Maci deemed Mackenzie “cool.” More than anything, Maci was grateful that Bentley got to experience a good time with both parents and their partners.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p><b>Amber Plays With Leah (for Like, an Hour)</b></p><p>When <b>Gary Shirley</b> called <a href=#><b>Amber Portwood</b></a> and asked her to pick up their daughter, Leah, from school because he was busy with a family emergency, the young mom jumped into action despite the fact that she doesn’t have custody of Leah during the week.</p><p>Gary was appreciative but wasn’t totally sold on the idea of Amber getting Leah on school nights. He ignored his ex’s request to keep their daughter overnight and sent his wife to get Leah from Amber’s house, causing the<i> Never Too Late </i>author to cry. She and her kid had only gotten to play together at the park for a little bit.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>At least she had something to look forward to: Amber scheduled the pre-op evaluation for her “mommy makeover,” which was designed to give her a look that would make her feel confident. As she began to sob, she explained that the weight gain she experienced was directly tied to her depression, and she just wanted to be happy.</p><p><b>Farrah Plays Games</b></p><p>In an awkward attempt at bonding, Farrah and mother <b>Debra Danielsen</b> were trying to garden. Just like last week, Farrah got stressed out and started screaming at her mom. Eventually, the young entrepreneur made her mother leave the garden all together. Once again, Debra began to cry as she sat in exile in her daughter’s house, telling a producer she’s so tired of not being loved.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Debra still helped with the opening of the furniture store the next day, assisting with the soft launch of the business while Farrah managed her frozen yogurt store. Later, as they got their nails done, Debra asked to have the next day off to run her own errands, and Farrah snapped, yelling at her in the middle of the salon.</p><p>When Farrah’s ex<b> Simon Saran</b> came over and asked her about it, the MTV star said that the trip to the nail salon had gone “well,” but quickly amended her statement with, “Not really.”</p><p>Simon told her that she and her mom have to learn to communicate better. Farrah got defensive and insisted that she’s not the one who causes scenes, so he called her out for causing a scene right then and there.</p><p>Tell <i>Us:</i> Should Gary trust Amber with Leah on school nights?</p><p><i>Teen Mom OG</i> airs on MTV Mondays at 9 p.m. ET.&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKuenZ5iurC5jKaYnKFdorKmwNJmqbKZnqh6qLXRpZ2roZWjsW6tzJucq2WSp7Kit9Jmm6ivnmLEdYGPcW1rZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dmvbmzszs7nlnv9u4ros583it1iplfkj.html><span>←</span><span>Watch ALVINNN!!! and The Chipmunks Season 2 Episode 20: Overlooked/Wish Upon a Star</span></a>
