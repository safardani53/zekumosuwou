The film is set in the ’50s and explores the origins of the inhuman spirit, also known as Valak, that tormented ghost-hunters Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga) in the 1977-set<i> The Conjuring 2.</i></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Eventually, the little girl got her wish.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy Andrea Villareal</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Photos from the June 3 birthday party showed little Lucia dressed as Valak, with her painted face featuring white and black circles around her eyes. She ran, jumped and played in the costume, and even had a birthday cake featuring the character’s face.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“So it was my cousins (sic) 3rd birthday and instead of having a normal theme she chose this,” <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Andrea Villarreal tweeted alongside the photos</a> on June 4. She <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>added in a follow-up post</a>: “And if anyone was wondering yes her friends also participated in the theme.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy Andrea Villareal</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The initial tweet quickly went viral.

HAPPY EVERY DAY!!”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The official Walking Dead account <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>replied to the tweet</a> with three black heart emoji.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Laura shared photos and videos <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>from the party on Facebook</a>, showing her sense of humor about the unique theme.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Like when your daughter turns 3, and her favorite character is the nun,” she <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>wrote in a Facebook post</a> on June 4. “Everything is to see her happy!!!”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Villarreal, of San Antonio, Texas, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>told the San Antonio Express-News</a> that the little girl’s parents were excited to make the spooky bash happen.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Her parents did not question it at all. They were very supportive of her wanting this theme, especially because Lucia was very persistent,” Villarreal told the outlet. “They had to go out of their way to make the pinata and cake special for the occasion because as you can imagine, those aren’t popular requests.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Villarreal added that Lucia doesn’t usually watch scary movies, so it came as a surprise that she took to The Nun.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I know people see The Nun and get scared, but Lucia tells her mom that nun is protecting her,” she said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ5iquqK6jKKlrZ2imsC1e9Oom52klad6r8HNZpmiqqSdsaLFjKmYq6ypYr2pu9Ooqmg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./american-reject-movie-kathleen-monteleone-interview.html><span>←</span><span>Kathleen Monteleone On Her Reality Show Past Hollywood Life</span></a>
