However, she<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> cherished filming the scene </a>with DeGeneres, who came out as a lesbian herself just one week before the episode aired.</p><p>“What was amazing, which I will never forget, that when she [DeGeneres] looked in my eyes, she said it was the first time she said ‘I’m gay’ out loud,” Dern said at the time. “We didn’t rehearse it, so when she said it to me, and was looking in my eyes and holding my hands and I felt her shaking … the <a href=# data-gift=1>gift</a> — it makes me want to cry — the gift of that, the intimacy of what that means, was such insight for me. And I’ll carry it for the rest of my life.”</p><p>Ellen paved the way for future LGBTQ characters, including Cyrus Goodman (<strong>Joshua Rush</strong>) who became the first main character to come out as gay on Disney Channel on Andi Mack in 2019.</p><p><strong>Peyton Elizabeth Lee</strong>, who portrayed the title character, told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety </a>in 2019 that it was monumental to include an LGBTQ character on a children’s show.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I think people don’t understand the importance of seeing yourself represented on TV,” Lee said. “Even I don’t think I understood the importance of representation until we started making our show, and I started seeing how kids were responding to it.”</p><p>Scroll down to see some of the most legendary LGBTQ TV characters.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq19mgm64xpurqmWkq3qktMCrmJyslafAbsPHqGSbnZOWuqZ5y56enqaUlr%2B6ecicpqerXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jessie-james-might-be-dating-reggie-bush.html><span>←</span><span>Jessie James Might Be Dating Reggie Bush</span></a>
