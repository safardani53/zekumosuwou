We love how the “Genie in a Bottle” singer&nbsp;exuded glamour AND edge, and we have to say, her slicked-back hairdo was everything! We can’t say we’re surprised though by Christina’s unique look — she ALWAYS makes sure to bring it on the fashion front. <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Click here to see more amazing pics of Christina Aguilera</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-2>Looking completely wow-worthy, Christina shamelessly showed off her cleavage in an all-black ensemble that she made look elegant and classy. The singer’s style is typically over-the-top, but we love how she toned it down during her tribute. Her makeup was also super minimal and she had her blonde locks slicked back in a wet style. Not much jewelry was necessary, but Christina did have on gorgeous crystal drop earrings, which was the icing on the cake for her glam look. SO stunning!</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>While Christina has never actually won an AMA, she has been nominated for the prestigious award twice. Back in 2001 she was up for Favorite Pop/Rock Female Artist, and in 2003 she was a hopeful for the&nbsp;International Artist of the Year Award. This year, however, she’s solely attending the show as a performer. In fact, the blonde bombshell will be honoring the late <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Whitney Houston</strong></a> with a 25th anniversary tribute. Christina’s performance&nbsp;will include songs from The Bodyguard — and we cannot wait to hear her belt out “I Will Always Love You.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/christina-embed.jpg alt="Christina Aguilera AMAs Performance Outfit 2017" width=620 height=900 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p id=content-paragraph-5>&nbsp;</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>No one is better qualified for this honor than Christina. After all,&nbsp;“Whitney herself stated in 2001 that Christina Aguilera sang the best version of her song ‘Run to You,’” Houston’s estate offered in a press release. Soon after the news was announced, the singer expressed her extreme gratitude for being chosen.&nbsp;“To be honoring&nbsp;the&nbsp;one and only, Whitney Houston, is a blessing and I am grateful to celebrate the spirit of her songs and legend that lives on,” Christina said in a statement.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>“I feel eternally fortunate to have personally met her on and off the stage. My deep appreciation for her kindness to me while coming up in the business — her graciousness, generosity, humanity and beauty — lived up to everything I could have hoped for in meeting my idol and will forever be cherished in my memory of her.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Tell us, <strong>HollywoodLifers</strong> — what do you think of Christina’s AMAs look this year?
