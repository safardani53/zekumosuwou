Like, you’re so safe, you’re so protected. They don’t get people to, like, come and visit all the time. They’re just grateful to have people to talk to.”</p><p>Kim went on to explain that the pair were going to meet with people who were incarcerated and had life sentences (which she calls “lifers”) and then “got out” after two decades.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Kim-Kardashian-and-Malika-Haqq-Visit-Prison-in-New-%E2%80%98The-Kardashians-Clip-%E2%80%98Theyre-Just-Like-Us-2.jpg><p>“So you’ll get to see that you might have this, like, stigma of, like, what people are like,” she told Malika. “They’re just like us. They might have made some, like, choices that we wouldn’t have, or, like, just some really bad circumstances that, like, things like this, I take and I’m like, ‘OK, this is what I want to teach our boys.’”</p><p>Viewers have watched Kim immerse herself in her new law career after registering with the California State Bar in 2018. While the reality star <a href=#>passed the First-Year Law Students’ Examination</a> (a.k.a. the ‘baby bar”) on her fourth try in December 2021, she recently revealed she is aiming to take the official bar exam in February 2025.</p><p>Since she has pursued her passion for criminal justice reform, Kim has even <a href=#>visited the White House</a> a few times to advocate for inmates seeking clemency. Kim previously credited her late father, <a href=#><strong>Robert Kardashian Sr.</strong></a>, for inspiring her journey to becoming a lawyer.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“We talked about it for sure when I was in college, but I wasn’t that serious,” she told Wall Street Journal magazine in October 2021. “Hopefully one day I can start a law firm where we can help people pro bono and hire people who were formerly incarcerated. I don’t see me floating on a yacht. I think I’ll always feel good when I’m working.”</p><p>Hulu releases new episodes of The Kardashians every Thursday.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKuhnV2grrOwwKyfopmeqHqkuMipZKShnWK4or7DmqqhoZGjeqK6w2akmqSZoK5utMCqqGaumai2tXnPq6Csp55k</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./people-realising-pricey-lemsip-no-better-painkiller.html><span>←</span><span>People are only just realising why cheap painkiller works just as well as Lemsip - and it's down to</span></a>
