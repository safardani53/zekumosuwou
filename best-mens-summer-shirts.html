This lightweight, loosely woven fibre is extremely breathable and has a distinct texture, making it instantly recognisable.</p><p>There’s cotton as well, which is slightly denser but still soft against the skin and perfect for patterned or striped shirts.</p><p>Other fabrics like pique cotton are slightly more technical and designed to keep the wearer dry. Regardless of which you go for, just make sure the fabric is lightweight so it won’t weigh you down.&nbsp;</p><h3>Style&nbsp;</h3><p>As you can imagine, there are numerous shirt styles available for summer. Go for a regular point collar for something smarter, or aim for a button-down for a smart casual staple that can be dressed up or down.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Sun Selects</h2></p><p>Try short sleeves for ultra-warm days, or mix things up with a Cuban or revere collar, which comes with a vintage-style open neck that makes it great for holidays in the sun.</p><h2>The best men's summer shirts, at a glance</h2><h2>Coofandy Linen Button-Down Shirt</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/My-project-1.png><li><strong>(AD) Coofandy Linen Button-Down Shirt, £26.99 from Amazon - <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener">buy here</a></strong></li><p>If you’re going to buy just one summer shirt style, make it a Cuban collar.
