In a brand new TikTok video this week, the 23-year old son of Christine Brown made it clear to followers just where he stands amid the ongoing drama taking place between his mother, his father and at least one other member of this polygamous family.
And he did so by wearing a rather unique shirt."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

You know?"</p><p>As you can see, the t-shirt asks one simple question across the front: <strong>What. Does. The Nanny.

Gives. Me. Life."</p><p>Wrote another approving fan:&nbsp;"Give Paedon his own tell all episode! Please, TLC."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Paedon’s mother, of course, <a href=#>confirmed her split from Kody</a> on November 2.</p><p>“After more than 25 years together, Kody and I have grown apart and I have made the difficult decision to leave,” the TV personality wrote in a statement via her Instagram page at the time.</p><p>“We will continue to be a strong presence in each other’s lives as we parent our beautiful children and support our wonderful family.</p><p>"At this time, we ask for your grace and kindness as we navigate through this stage within our family. With Love, Christine Brown.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Shortly afterward, it came out that <a href=#>Robyn played a major role</a> in Christine’s decision to walk away.</p><p>“It’s no shock. She’s been in the process of leaving him for a while," an insider told Us Weekly late last year of Christine’s bold move, adding:</p><p>"The big reason why she split from him is because Kody has been completed devoted to Robyn for the past five or six years.</p><p>"That hasn’t changed at all."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Indeed, it’s been a recurring theme for years on Sister Wives that Robyn — who is Kody’s only legal wife — is by far his favorite.</p><p>The father of 18 spent the bulk of his COVID-related quarantine shacking up with this spouse, much to the annoyance of his other better halves.</p><p>“[Christine’s] really hurting. She really loved Kody. She gave him her all in hope that he would love her,” this same source told Us a few months ago.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Concluded the mole back then:</p><p>“Kody has not been around at all.</p><p>"He used COVID-19 as a big excuse to not be around family. It’s been his ticket to freedom essentially.</p><p>"This destroyed Christine because she really tried to give her all to the marriage.”</p><p>If true, that’s too bad.</p><p>But at least Christine can count on <a href=#>Paedon to mock his father</a> any chance he gets.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2tqX2V%2FcLzAnpuopl2Xv7DDzWarq6ecocBuvs6bsKdlo6m2s7%2BMrqdmmZyheqy1zZ2qZqeWYsCqv9OeqWavmauytHnDq5ho</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./katie-couric-daughters-4862439.html><span>←</span><span>Meet Her Daughters, Ellie, &amp;amp; Caroline Hollywood Life</span></a>
