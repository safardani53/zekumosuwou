My son is on it more than me these days ever since he got his first phone for Christmas.”</p><p>Thankfully for the millions of people watching on TV, Bingham has promised not to wear the dress again – even if he wins a second world title on May 3.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NINTCHDBPICT000648643489.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NINTCHDBPICT000647401930.jpg><p>First, he has to get past the returning Welshman Jamie Jones in the Last 16 on Sunday and Monday.</p><p>It has been christened as the Battle of the Banned given the pair have both served suspensions from the Tour for breaching betting regulations.</p><p>In October 2017, Bingham received a six-month ban – three months and one day were suspended – for betting on snooker matches.
