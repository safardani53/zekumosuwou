Shortly after, he rounded up a few of his colleagues and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>attempted to drive them to safety</a>, according to New York Times reporter Jack Nicas.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Like many residents in Paradise, they quickly hit gridlock,” Nicas wrote of the group in a tweet on Monday. “But unfortunately for them, they were stuck in the middle of the fire. Flames licked at the side of his truck, and as Allyn watched other cars catch fire, he thought his was next.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>GoFundMe</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">With flames just outside his window, Pierce turned on a calming song — Peter Gabriel’s “In Your Eyes” — and recorded a goodbye message for his family, saying, “Just in case this doesn’t work out, I want you to know I really tried to make it out.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Just then, a bulldozer appeared, clearing a burning vehicle out of Pierce’s way to he could flee. However, the nurse decided to risk his life once more, by returning to the hospital, according to Nicas. By the time he and the colleagues made it back to Feather River Hospital, Pierce’s white truck had burn marks on the sides, at least one of the trucks mirrors was damaged and the lights on the truck were melted.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">They returned to the hospital and began helping injured<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1> residents who had gone to the facility for help</a>, according to the Times. When the hospital caught on fire, he helped other medical staff move the patients to the hospital’s helipad. Everyone survived.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Now all of us are like, ‘Oh, this is what we do,’ ” Pierce recalled to the Times. “We’re terrible at burning to death, but we’re amazing at taking care of people.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Justin Sullivan/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As thousand’s retweeted Pierce’s story on social media, Toyota officials offered to replace the man’s truck, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>writing in an Instagram comment</a>: “We are humbled you’d risk your life and Toyota Tundra to drive people to safety. Don’t worry about your truck, we’re honored to get you a new one!”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Pierce wasn’t the only hero of the day. Tamara Ferguson, also a nurse at the hospital, detailed the harrowing <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>evacuation in a Facebook post last week</a>. Ferguson revealed that she and her co-workers ended up briefly caring for patients in the garage of a nearby home as they attempted to flee the burning area.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“We were an Awesome team of mostly strangers doing whatever we could as HAD to and we did phenomenal! … I honestly couldn’t believe I was alive, that I would see my family, kids, and boyfriend again.
