She shared photos of them kissing while in front of a wintery forest.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>As for the grandparents, they’re both definitely excited that their oldest daughter is a mom! Demi, 60, and Bruce, 67, must be very happy for Rumer and Derek. Before the little one arrived, the&nbsp;G.I.

Even though they split, it’s clear that they <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>remain good friends</a> and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>amazing co-parents</a> to their adult daughters. The whole extended family regularly <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>gets together for holidays.</a> Besides Rumer, they also have daughters <strong>Scout,&nbsp;</strong>31, and&nbsp;<strong>Tallulah,&nbsp;</strong>28. After the split, Demi notably married&nbsp;<strong>Ashton Kutcher&nbsp;</strong>from 2005 to 2013, and Bruce married&nbsp;<strong>Emma Hemming,&nbsp;</strong>who he has two more daughters with:&nbsp;<strong>Mabel,&nbsp;</strong>10, and&nbsp;<strong>Evelyn,&nbsp;</strong>8.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>The birth comes nearly a year after Rumer and her family shared the sad news that Bruce was <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>retiring from acting</a> after receiving a diagnosis of a rare form of aphasia. She shared the heartbreaking news in a statement alongside her mom, stepmom, sisters, and half-sisters. “Bruce is stepping away from the career that has meant so much to him. This is a really challenging time for our family and we are so appreciative of your continued love, compassion and support. We are moving through this as a strong family unit, and wanted to bring his fans in because we know how much he means to you, as you do to him. As Bruce always says, ‘Live it up,’ and together we plan to do just that,” they wrote in the statement, shared on social media.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH11e5FuZqutnZq%2FbsPIpaOiq12XrqPFjJ%2Bgq6ukYr2pu9OoZJ2ZpZy1tbHRZqOorZWpwaJ5yKyjnrFdqbWwucCsZLChnKG2tHs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./luke-combs-apologizes-unknowingly-filing-lawsuit-against-fan-8415784.html><span>←</span><span>Luke Combs Apologizes After Unknowingly Suing Fan for $250K over Unofficial Merch</span></a>
