"It's sad because I love Shannon very much. I have loved her more deeply than any woman in my life. She's one of a kind; so funny and generous and full of life and adventurous. We have a connection that's unlike anything I've ever had. And I know that for as long as I live, I'll never meet anyone like her again.</p><p>"But that doesn't mean we're&nbsp;right for each other for the rest of our lives."</p><p>He continued: "It doesn't make sense to be together if you don't believe in it.</p><p>"The last thing I wanted to do is hurt Shannon, but I do think I did the right thing for the both of us.</p><p>"We're two people who&nbsp;love each other very much, but love is not always enough. And while I know Shannon sees it as I've said things to her I never meant, I hope she'll be able to see that there's no bad person here. It's two really good people who couldn't make it work."</p><h2>'BLINDSIDED'</h2><p>Shannon also spoke with PEOPLE following the split, revealing that she was "blindsided by the breakup."</p><p>"All I can do is repeat in my head what he said to me while we were filming," Shannon said.</p><p>"We were in a great place. But seven days later, when the cameras were down, it was a completely different story. He told me he was done with the relationship. And to hear what he said to me then was absolutely devastating.</p><p>"I've never loved anyone more in my life,"&nbsp;she continued.</p><p>"I was hopeful this was the man I was going to spend the rest of my life with. I&nbsp;wanted it to work out. I've never loved anyone like I've loved John.
