In 1987, however, she put her touring dreams on hold to move home and care for her siblings following the death of her mother and stepfather in a car crash.</p><p>After working as a singer at a local resort, Twain landed her first record deal, and in April 1993, she released her self-titled debut album. The record didn’t reach the commercial heights of her later work, but her music caught the attention of some country fans — and one producer in particular.</p><p><strong>Robert John “Mutt” Lange</strong> offered to produce for the “You Win My Love” singer after hearing some of her music, and the duo began work on Twain’s second album, The Woman in Me, <a href=#>while also sparking a romance</a>. They tied the knot in December 1993 and later welcomed a son, Eja, in August 2001.</p><p>Lange — known for his work with rock artists including AC/DC and Foreigner — produced Twain’s third and fourth albums as well, but the “Giddy Up!” singer has always made it clear that he wasn’t the sole architect of her image.</p><p>“As a producer, he is very much a director as well; very hands-on and very talented,” the Grammy winner told The Guardian in 2018, nearly a decade after her divorce from Lange. “So, he was driving the direction of the sound. He didn’t drive the direction of my voice and never tried to change me.”</p><p>Twain seemed unstoppable in the late 1990s and early 2000s. When <a href=#>she was bitten by a tick in 2003</a>, however, the course of her career changed forever. She <a href=#>contracted Lyme disease from the bite</a>, but it took some time for her to receive a diagnosis.</p><p>“My symptoms were quite scary because before I was diagnosed, I was on stage very dizzy,” she <a href=#>recalled in her 2022 documentary</a>, Shania Twain: Not Just a Girl. “I was losing my balance. I was afraid I was gonna fall off the stage, and the stage is quite high.”</p><p>The Broad City alum estimated that it took seven years for doctors to determine how the disease affected her vocal cords. Twain underwent open-throat surgery so that she could sing again, but she still hears a difference in her voice.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“My speaking voice is definitely the biggest effort. Sometimes I get a bit raspy … singing is actually easier,” she said during an August 2020 interview on the U.K. talk show Loose Women. “I have more power when I’m singing now. I have more character, I find. I enjoy singing again. Speaking is the more difficult challenge for me than singing, which [is] OK, I’ll take that!”</p><p>Keep scrolling for a look back at Twain’s life and career:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BotaK6yJpkra%2BRnrtuwMerpq6fmGLBqbGMspyaqqNitaa%2BjKWgn51dnrtuvMeoq6irXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./matt-keeslar.html><span>←</span><span>Matt Keeslar</span></a>
