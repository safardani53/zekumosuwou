When he’s been in LA, he’s been staying with music producer friends.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/kanye-west-moved-out-LA-mansion-kim-kardashian-divorce-mega-post.jpg> The parents plan to co-parent their kids, <a href=#><strong>North</strong></a>, 7, <a href=#><strong>Saint</strong></a>, 5, <a href=#><strong>Chicago</strong></a>, 3, and <strong>Psalm</strong>, 1, and although Kim <a href=#>requested</a> they share joint physical and legal custody, she has reportedly been spending more time with the kids recently. “Kim is the main caretaker for these children and has been having them primarily, but <span class=mark02jzfjfhl data-markjs=true data-ogac data-ogab data-ogsc data-ogsb>Kanye</span> does FaceTime with them often,” the source explained. After the “Jesus Walks” creator made headlines for <a href=#>moving 500 pairs of sneakers</a> and other things out of their home just a couple of weeks before Kim filed the paperwork for their divorce, it’s clear to see there must be a lot of new space and it’s apparently prompting Kim to redecorate. “Kim has been doing a lot of reorganizing and redecorating of their home,” the insider said. “It’s turned into a warehouse of all of her brands now with the extra space.” <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/kanye-west-moved-out-LA-mansion-kim-kardashian-divorce-mega-post2.jpg><p>“She wasted no time once all of <span class=mark02jzfjfhl data-markjs=true data-ogac data-ogab data-ogsc data-ogsb>Kanye</span>‘s things were out,” the insider continued. “Things haven’t changed really because <span class=mark02jzfjfhl data-markjs=true data-ogac data-ogab data-ogsc data-ogsb>Kanye</span>&nbsp;hasn’t been in the LA home for so long, but she’s utilizing all of the extra space and making it a new home. She’s having fun with it. She loves the home and never had plans to leave it.”</p>Kim and Kanye, who <a href=#>were married in 2014</a>, have been living in separate places for a while. As she stays at the Calabasas home, he’s been staying in his ranch in Wyoming for the most part. They have yet to speak publicly about their divorce.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH10e49wZqSZnq6ybsPErKtmpZ%2BrsqV5zq6rZpuRoa6jrdKaqmagn6KybrfIpmSkmaKZrrS0yJqlZpyZq7yzr8Ro</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nazeeh-johnson.html><span>←</span><span>Fame | Nazeeh Johnson net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</span></a>
