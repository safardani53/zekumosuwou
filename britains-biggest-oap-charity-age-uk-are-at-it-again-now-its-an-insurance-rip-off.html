And the rip-off is quite shocking.</p><p>Financier Andrew Brettell was looking round for cover for his house in Clapham, South West London, and Tesco came up with a very fair £166.40. As he was 52 (you have to be 50-plus to use their site) he went on Age UK and they came back with...wait for it...£1,154.74, a staggering seven times the Tesco price.</p><p>And their explanation was simply bulls**t.</p><p>To discover why their price was 600 per cent higher, Mr Brettell contacted Doug Strachan, managing director of the charity’s commercial arm.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/nintchdbpict000172501925.jpg><p>He explained the increase by saying:</p><ul><li>You have a high-value property — that wasn’t a problem for Tesco. Clearly cobblers.</li><li>You have lots of flat roofs — that wasn’t a problem for Tesco. Complete cobblers.</li><li>Clapham is a high-risk crime area — so is the whole of London. That wasn’t a problem for Tesco. Even more cobblers.</li><li>And finally, your YOUNG age — 52? What on earth has that got to do with his home insurance and why didn’t it affect Tesco? Absolute cobblers.</li></ul><p>The charity is simply making this stuff up on the hoof. How much of the excessive profit of almost £1,000 over the Tesco price is split between them and their insurance provider Ageas?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/nintchdbpict000311255470.jpg><p>If you or your parents are covered by Age UK, get the hell out of it. There’s something quite wrong with the way this charity exploits older people.</p><p>First it was energy, now home insurance. What other tricks are they playing on the old? We should be told.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN OPINION</h2></p><h2>Day for us dads a boring routine</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/nintchdbpict000163159348.jpg><p>THERE is an old Jewish proverb: “God could not be everywhere and therefore he made mothers.”</p><p>I agree with that but why is Mother’s Day such a success both emotionally and commercially (try to book a lunch table) while Father’s Day is a going-through-the-motions routine without any real family commitment?

Such a shame.</p><h2>Twit Jon upsets balance</h2><p>SO sad to see Jon Snow and the strange crew running Channel Four News making a painful cock-up of the Westminster Bridge massacre by naming the wrong killer, who was in fact languishing in an HMP cell at the time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/nintchdbpict000307270751.jpg><p>I’m prepared to offer lessons in journalism to C4 next time they doorstep me. Bad that the mistake was, it was a tweet by Jon Snow – 24 hours before the blunder – that caught my attention.</p><p>On the <a href=#>death of mass killer Martin McGuinness</a> he said: “A great loss; an extraordinary life that culminated in great service.” A great loss? A great gain in Hell would have been more appropriate.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/nintchdbpict000311754388.jpg><p>He literally sanctioned the deaths of hundreds of innocent people. Why no mention of that, Mr Snow?</p><p>This is an issue for media regulator Ofcom, who insist there is balance in news coverage but allow tweets of a one-sided nature which will inform audiences of what the presenters are thinking while asking their questions.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/nintchdbpict000310528782.jpg><p>Snow and the like use Twitter as a cheap form of marketing for their real thoughts. It’s a neat trick now being used by left-wing presenters in radio as well.</p><p>If broadcast staff having opinions in a powerful medium like television is to be allowed, I would happily start my own station tomorrow. Over to you, Ofcom.</p><br><p>• AS an endangered species, us Charlton supporters have to stick together, which is why I am grateful to Maurice Seamons for getting in touch.</p><p>He was furious with his brokers Bluefin, who said they were “pleased” to tell him his car insurance was £482.11, 50 per cent higher than last year.</p><p>All these brokers say they are “pleased” on renewal, and so would I be if I ran their racket. Don’t use them.</p><p>Maurice didn’t come to my price comparison site <a href=#>A Spokesman Said</a> but went to Direct Line, where he was covered for £298.10.</p><p>Very pleasing.</p><p>Do send your saving stories to <a href=#>kelvin@the-sun.co.uk</a>.</p><h2>A Relief am here to help</h2><p>WITH the latest stats showing Jockistan has economic issues, health issues, schooling issues and even procreation issues, why doesn’t the BBC stop focusing on Africa and start a Tartan Nose Day for our chums over the border?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/nintchdbpict000159009090.jpg><p>My only concern is that the Scots might not contribute to their own charity. I am reminded of the visitor to an Aberdeen bar where beer was being sold at 2p a pint to mark the pub’s centenary.</p><p>The bar was empty and the visitor asked where the regulars were. The barman replied: “They’re waiting for Happy Hour.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/nintchdbpict0002901416201.jpg><p>The Scots are sick of stereotyping, with one emailing the local paper in Dundee saying: “If you print any more jokes about mean Scots I will stop reading your paper in the library.”</p><p>Tartan Nose Day is surely an idea of its time.</p><h2>Punnies</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/nintchdbpict000311679586.jpg><p>CHIP shop in Treorchy, South Wales,– A Fish Called Rhondda.<br>Hairdresser’s in Truro, Cornwall – Fat Boy Trims.</p><p>Chinese takeaway in St Merryn, Cornwall – Toucan Choo.<br>Furniture shop in Skegness, Lincs – Suite Dreams.<br>Dentist’s in Wideopen, Newcastle upon Tyne – Wideopen Dental Practice.<br>Dog groomer’s in Sydney, Australia – Spic ’n’ Spaniel.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Two daughters, two different paths</h3></p><p>One converts to Islam and wears a full face veil.
