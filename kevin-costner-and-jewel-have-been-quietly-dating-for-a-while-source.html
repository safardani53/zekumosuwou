But the consensus is that he’s found a real keeper in Jewel and that this has the makings of something that could be very special.”</p><p>Costner and Jewel (whose full name is Jewel Kilcher) were first spotted earlier this month getting cozy during a trip to Necker Island in the British Virgin Islands. In photos published by TMZ on December 8, the duo were seen getting cozy while attending a tennis fundraiser for <a href=#>Jewel’s Inspiring Children Foundation</a>. In one snap, Costner had his arms wrapped around Jewel’s waist as she held a microphone while seemingly addressing other attendees at the event. The pair also posed for a group photo while matching in all-white ensembles.</p><p>The outing came seven months after Baumgartner, 49, filed for divorce from Costner in May after <a href=#>18 years of marriage</a>. The former couple share sons Cayden, 16, and Hayes, 14, and daughter Grace, 13. (Costner also shares daughters Annie, 39, and Lily, 37, and son Joe, 35, with ex-wife <strong>Cindy Silva</strong> and son Liam, 27, with ex <strong>Bridget Rooney</strong>.)</p><p>Costner and Baumgartner <a href=#>settled their divorce</a> in September after a lengthy back-and-forth over child support and the date Baumgartner had to <a href=#>vacate the family’s California home</a>.</p><p>“This is a horrible place to be, but this is where we’re at,” <a href=#>Costner told Access Hollywood</a> in September. “It feels so bad, and we’re talking about somebody I love on the other side, I just can’t.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Prior to her romance with Costner, Jewel was previously married to rodeo cowboy <strong>Ty Murray</strong> from 2008 to 2014. The former couple share son Kase Townes, 12.</p><p>For more on Jewel and Costner’s romance, watch the video above and pick up the new issue of Us Weekly, on stands now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaknaaeu26vzqyrp52iYq6vsIyjnLCdnGK1osLEZpmenZ5ivra1xK2jsmWUlsGqusZmnaiqXZZ6uLTIpZxmq5%2Bqv6Sxjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./criminal-minds.html><span>←</span><span>Criminal Minds Season 5 Episodes</span></a>
