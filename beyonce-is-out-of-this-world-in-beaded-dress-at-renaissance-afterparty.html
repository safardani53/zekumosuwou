At the center was a cobalt blue gem surrounded by rhinestones. The piece then fell into an asymmetrical miniskirt.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Beyoncé complemented the look with velvet ballroom gloves, sheer tights and black pointed-toe heels. She opted for dangling earrings, soft glam and wore her recently transformed platinum tresses in a bouncy half-up half-down ‘do.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>The fierce fashion moment wasn’t the only gift from Queen Bey. The Grammy winner treated fans to a new song, teased in the credits of the movie, which chronicles the development and execution of the Renaissance World Tour and is in theaters now.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Beyonce-Outfit-Change-After-Renny-2.jpg><p class=p1><span class=s1>Titled “My House,” and co-produced by <strong>The Dream</strong>, the track continues the disco era of <a href=#>Renaissance</a> with a bouncy and lively beat as she belts, “Me and my thug bae got’ slide tonight (Slide tonight) / Call the paparazzi, ain’t got clips to hide tonight (Boom, pow) / Cash out this pain, call Lorraine (Schwartz).”&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>In addition to the tour, film and new music, Beyoncé has been busy racking up awards and expanding her business portfolio.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>In February, she broke the record for <a href=#>most Grammy wins of all time</a> with 32. In October, she officially introduced her <a href=#>new fragrance, Ce Noir</a>, after <a href=#>teasing a haircare line</a> in May.&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“How many of y’all knew my first job was sweeping hair in my mama’s salon?” Beyoncé wrote alongside the beauty announcement at the time. “Destiny’s Child got our start by performing for clients while they were getting their hair done. I was exposed to so many different kinds of entrepreneurial women in her salon.”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>She added: “I saw firsthand how the ways we nurture and celebrate hair can directly impact our souls. I watched her heal and be of service to so many women. Having learned so much on my hair journey, I’ve always dreamed of carrying on her legacy. I can’t wait for you to experience what I’ve been creating.”</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX5eyurvNnJxmoaNivLbAjKidZqyYnsBuw86ro51lmaN6o7HAnZydZZSnsrS%2FjJqrZqqVo66qv9KapZydXZaztbHRqZirrKlk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./yohan-geronimo-to-daniele-gates-you-ruined-my-birthday.html><span>←</span><span>Yohan Geronimo to Daniele Gates: You RUINED My Birthday!</span></a>
