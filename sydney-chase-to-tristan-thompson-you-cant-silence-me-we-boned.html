received a cease-and-desist letter from Tristan Thompson.</p><p>She confirmed our report that the professional basketball player has threatened her with legal action if she keeps alleging the pair

src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/the-hollywood-gossip-res.cloudinary.com/iu/cs_srgb></p><p>Sydney Chase is fresh out of f–ks to give.</p><p>She’s just here to speak her personal truth.</p><p>“I finally received the cease & desist hours after I made my post online,” Chase wrote on her Instagram Story last night as a follow-up to her initial claim that she was NOT sent this message.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/the-hollywood-gossip-res.cloudinary.com/iu/cs_srgb><p>“It was first sent to an email I no longer use."</p><p>"However, I’m moving forward with the truth & am choosing not to comply."</p><p>Chase, as you likely know, made national headliines several days ago when she went on a podcast and said she had intercourse with Thompson earlier this year.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>She got explicit in her admission, too.</p><p>“It <a href=#>was a peek-a-boo d–k</a> but baby it was good," Chase said on air, referring to, well… it’s pretty obvious what she was referring to, isn’t it?</p><p>“I did not know [he was in a relationship] … he told me he wasn’t in a relationship anymore," <a href=#>Sydney Chase</a> elaborated on the podcast.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Despite Tristan and Khloe Kardashian having been pretty open for awhile now about their status, she claims she didn’t know.</p><p>The 23-year-old did not specify exactly when she first started f–king Thompson.</p><p>She didn’t provide any evidence of their hook-up or produce any text messages she swears he sent her, either.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Chase did state, however, that she last talked to Tristan around hiis daughter’s birthday – which was just a few weeks ago.</p><p>Thompson has a historry here, of course.</p><p>He cheated on Khloe when she was very pregnant with daughter True, and then again about a year later after Kardashian was willing to forgive and try to forget.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>He’s also been accused of ditching his first baby mama for Khloe back when she was pregnant with their son.</p><p>The guy is good at banging in the paint on a basketball court, and also good at banging women behind the back of his significant other.</p><p>In this case, though?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>A&nbsp;<a href=#>cease-and-desist letter penned this week</a> by Marty Singer, Thompson’s attorney, refers to Chase’s affair allegations as "malicious defamatory fabrications."</p><p>"Mr. Thompson had no relationship with you whatsoever and he never sent you any such texts," the letter says.</p><p>Singer alleges that Chase is just making crap up about his client, stating plainly:&nbsp;</p><p>"It is obvious that you are a liar."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>And if Chase continues to go around peddling this story and trying to make a name for herself based on an alleged dalliance with Thompson?</p><p>The letter tells Chase that should she keep on "defaming" Thompson in the media, well …</p><p>"You do so at your peril since you may find yourself in court attempting to defend your indefensible misconduct."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The model, however, keeps talking a good game.</p><p>She appears to be undeterred.</p><p>“I will not be called a liar,” she wrote on Instagram.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>When asked by Page Six if she had any evidence of her alleged affair with the baller, Chase replied:</p><p>“Yes, I obviously do but this is now a legal matter that lawyers will handle."</p><p>"Thanks.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>So there, in other words. Mic drop.</p><p>Regardless of whether she can actually prove this f–king took place, does anyone actually believe that horndog isn’t ready, willing and able to engage in exactly this kind of conduct?</p><p>And if so, is it even defamatory?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Chase also said <a href=#>Thompson said Khloe isn’t his type</a>, and that he just enjoys the status of being with her.</p><p>Almost gotta admire the guy’s dedication to being this shady, knowing he’ll get caught and it’ll be public.</p><p>You don’t become a world-class player overnight!</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2tpX2WCcL%2FYnaWesV2YtaK%2FxGarqGWkp7a0wMCnZK2gn6K9tLvNZrCorV2Yrq%2FAjKygpZ2emLJuucRmrp5lkqS7prCO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./simone-biles-boyfriend-seemingly-alludes-to-her-brothers-arrest.html><span>←</span><span>Simone Biles Boyfriend Seemingly Alludes to Her Brothers Arrest</span></a>
