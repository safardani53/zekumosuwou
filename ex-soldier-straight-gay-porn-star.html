Daniel McGraffin, from Wigan, says his girlfriend is comfortable with his unusual career because he earns a fortune for “a few hours work.”
The gym-chiselled performer, whose stage name is Geordie Jackson, ended up in the porn business after spending eight months in military prison after going AWOL.
Speaking on Channel 5 documentary 'The Sex Business: Swinging Both Ways', which aired last night, he said: “I was in the artillery for six years, it was decided from when I was a kid."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

The guy rings us and says, ‘the majority of it's fake.’</p><p>“He then offered Daniel £750 for a short shoot.”</p><p>After his first lucrative outing, looking for more work, Daniel contacted high profile production company Lucas Entertainment – which eventually offered him a three year contract.</p><p>Daniel said: “I did look into straight porn, in gay porn there's way less competition, and there's no money in straight porn.</p><p>“Lucas Entertainment are the biggest gay porn company in the world.

It's either this or going to work in a warehouse, 'cause I have no qualifications.</p><p>“You need to make your money, man. I'm glad I found porn because I make more money now than I ever have.</p><p>“I'm not in it for pleasure, regardless of what anyone thinks. I'm in it because it's a well paid job, and I'm not going to make that kind of money, legally, anywhere else.”</p><p>Daniel admits that not everyone in his family knows what he does for a living.</p><p>He said: “My mum hasn't got a clue I do porn. She knows I do some kind of gay modelling, I could never tell her, she'd probably just laugh but I can't physically get it out of my mouth to her.</p><p>“I told my sisters, but Mum and Dad are different.
