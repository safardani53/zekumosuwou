He rocked a fresh cut with light gray hair as he held two bouquets of yellow roses and one bouquet of white and orange roses each. He kept it casual with his apparel as he wore a black sweatshirt, T-shirt and jeans.

In the period piece, he flaunts shoulder-length brown locks. While both looks are extremely different, he is somehow able to impressively pull both off.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>The former James Bond may be a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>hunk</a> but unfortunately, he has been taken for a while now. He has been married to&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Keely Shaye Smith</a>, </strong>58, for over 20 years. She’s a journalist now but before she started dating the&nbsp;Mamma Mia!&nbsp;actor, she had an acting career. She starred in small roles in a number of films and TV shows including&nbsp;General Hospital, Norman’s Corner&nbsp;and&nbsp;The Opponent.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Pierce-Brosnans-wife-Keely-Shaye-Smith-shutter-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Pierce and Keely share two adult <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>children</a> together,&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Dylan Brosnan</a>,&nbsp;</strong>25, and&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Paris Brosnan</a>,&nbsp;</strong>20. The&nbsp;False Positive&nbsp;actor has three children from his previous marriage to&nbsp;<strong>Cassandra Harris.&nbsp;</strong>Before passing away from ovarian cancer, she gave birth to&nbsp;<strong>Christopher&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>Charlotte&nbsp;</strong>with her late former husband <strong>Dermot Harris&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>Sean Brosnan&nbsp;</strong>with Pierce. Pierce ended up adopting Christopher and Charlotte after their mother passed.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Pierce has expressed how important family has become to him, especially during the pandemic. “I cherish family very much,” Pierce told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Gentleman’s Journal</a>&nbsp;in 2021. “I cherish being a father. I did not grow up with a father figure or with a solid family. There was deep fracture, a certain isolation and an aloneness which wielded the wonderful power of my imagination. I had to get by on my own sensing and intuition. So I value and love the family.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH1ye5BwZqmhlaewpnnBq6asppGjeqi%2BwLJkoZmZp3qnuM6wnKtlo528sbzIp55mqJikwbC%2Fjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./school-closures-uk-snow-ice.html><span>←</span><span>Full list of school closures as snow and ice warnings hit UK today - are you affected?</span></a>
