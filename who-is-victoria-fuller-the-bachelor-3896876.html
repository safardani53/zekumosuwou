What Happened To Victoria On ‘The Bachelor’?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Victoria-Fuller-bachelor-in-paradise-abc-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>On season 24 of&nbsp;The Bachelor, Victoria was painted as the villain by viewers and several cast members. Drama always seemed to follow Victoria, beginning from her very first <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>one-on-one with Peter</a>. The two attended a&nbsp;<strong>Chase Rice</strong> concert and it was revealed that Victoria and Chase <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>had history</a>. She eventually came clean to Peter about previously dating Chase, and although he was upset that she didn’t fill him in sooner, they were able to get past it.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Then, on <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Victoria’s hometown date</a>, Peter ran into a woman that&nbsp;he had previously dated who also knew Victoria. The woman accused Victoria of breaking up “many relationships” in the past. Peter confronted Victoria about it and she got defensive, denying the accusations. He decided not to meet her family, but still wanted to give their relationship one more shot and gave her a rose at the rose ceremony.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Peter and Victoria spent the night together in the fantasy suite, but he<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> eliminated her</a> at the following rose ceremony. He told her that his relationships with&nbsp;<strong>Madison Prewett</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>Hannah Ann Sluss</strong> were farther along than his relationship with her. Victoria was upset and left the show in tears.</p><h2>2. Victoria Dated Chris Soules</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>After her season of&nbsp;The Bachelor aired in winter 2020, Victoria began dating another Bachelor Nation alum,&nbsp;<strong>Chris Soules</strong>. The two were set up by&nbsp;<strong>Kelsey Weier</strong>, who was also on Victoria’s season. Kelsey knew Chris because they were both from Iowa, and she gave Victoria his phone number. After three weeks of talking and FaceTiming, Victoria flew to Iowa to meet Chris in person.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>That spring, Victoria and Chris <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>social distanced together</a> during the coronavirus pandemic, and the similar locations in their social media posts were what tipped fans off to the relationship. They dated for the next few months before breaking up at the end of summer 2020.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>“We went a separate direction,” she explained to&nbsp;<strong>Nick Viall</strong> on his podcast that September. “But I respect him so much. I think he’s an amazing man. I just think that, like, right now I’m in a very different place than he is. And I’m not moving to Iowa anytime soon.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Victoria-Fuller-bachelor-in-paradise-abc-embed-2.jpg><h2>3. Victoria Has A Service Dog</h2><p id=content-paragraph-10>Victoria has a dog named Buxton, who she says has helped with her anxiety. She also revealed in a 2020&nbsp; Instagram post that he was training to become a therapy dog, too. “As a therapy dog, Buxton will be providing comfort to children in hospitals, affection in retirement homes, love to those who may be having a hard time at school & others who maybe just need a hug,” she explained. As of 2022, Victoria still has Buxton and says he’s her “best friend.” She also has a cat that she named Cat.</p><h2>4.

However, the name of the company she worked for at the time was not confirmed&nbsp;Her now-deleted LinkedIn page revealed that she used to work at TEKsystems, and also that she worked as a substitute teacher in local Virginia Beach schools.</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>After appearing on&nbsp;The Bachelor, Victoria briefly moved to Los Angeles, then re-located to Nashville. It does not appear that she still works in Medical Sales.&nbsp;Victoria attended Old Dominion University and graduated with a degree in Economics in 2015.</p><h2>5. Is Victoria Saving Herself For Marriage?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-13>In April 2021, Victoria revealed that she joined a nondenominational Christian community in Nashville and found a new passion for religion. At the time, she said she planned on saving herself for marriage, but it’s unclear if that is still the case a year and a half later. “I grew up so Catholic that everything I did was judged or I always felt like I was doing something wrong,” Victoria admitted. “I never felt accepted. And now I’m opened up to this world where God is so good and he forgives.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2LDqq%2FTqKmimV2bwq24xKtkraCVYq%2Bir8eeo6iqXWiFeoKXcG1o</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mel-b-topless-for-breast-cancer-awareness.html><span>←</span><span>Topless For Breast Cancer Awareness!</span></a>
