While it's consensual, many felt that since she posted it directly to Twitter without any kind of warning (such as blurred images), she triggered users and created an uncomfortable (and potentially harmful) environment. What's worse, is that "Belle Delphine" is trending and people might accidentally click on her name without any warning.</p><p>"Hey everyone pls don’t look at the belle delphine tag she did a photoshoot where she is kidnapped and assaulted dressed as a child. Sorry for no tws but i don't want people who have this muted to not be warned," one person tweeted.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Hey everyone pls don’t look at the belle delphine tag she did a photoshoot where she is kidnapped and assaulted dressed as a child.

For instance, she sold bottles of her own bathwater for $30, and the internet was simultaneously repulsed and also intrigued. Before she took a social media break, she also vandalized a car and claimed she was arrested, though nobody knows if this is true.</p><p>Allegedly, she vandalized the car because someone had stolen her hamster. "stg this girl came to my party and stole my hamster. I have no idea why, or who tf does that? I spray painted the f*** out of her car and got arrested, at least I got my hamster back. b*tch," <a href=# rel=nofollow>she tweeted</a>. In one of the photos, she shows a painting of Pepe the Frog, a meme which was hijacked by white supremacists, and the "okay" sign, which is also a hand gesture used by white supremacists.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>In 2019, <a href=# rel=nofollow>Belle was kicked off of Instagram</a> for lewd content. She eventually came back, and now has over 600,000 followers. The same thing happened to her YouTube channel in November 2020. Her channel was taken down after a NSFW video was caught by the YouTube police, but according to Belle, she didn't get any kind of warning.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"I'm fine with YouTube removing that video though, it was super NSFW, but to remove my whole channel with no warning is extreme. I wasn't even going to post s*it like that anymore to YouTube, so that's a bummer. Not even allowed to make a new YouTube account, I already tried," she said.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Though Belle got her Instagram and YouTube back, her more explicit content is available through OnlyFans and Patreon. While you can pay $1 or $5 for her Patreon content, she also offers a more "premium" offering that will set people back $2,500.&nbsp;</p><p>Belle also took an interesting approach when she entered the PornHub world. She uploaded videos that trolled users, like one titled "PEWDIEPIE goes all the way INSIDE Belle Delphine," and shows her pretending to eat a print-out of Pewdiepie's face. She's uploaded other videos that take a very literal approach to porn, like one that promises her "scissoring" (it shows her cutting paper with scissors). Well played?&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Belle Delphine has yet to respond to the recent backlash, but it's likely she won't.
