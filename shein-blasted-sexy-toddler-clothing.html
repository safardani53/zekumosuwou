a variety of complaints have been made about the brand - from poor quality of clothing to an ethical trade-off too.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on Shein">Read more on Shein</h2><p>But now, <span id=4effa965-f24b-489f-a99f-5c0ed6ead0b1 class=suggested-link>Shein</span> has been blasted for its ‘sexy’ toddler clothes.&nbsp;</p><p>While many parents would dress their little darling in jumpers and leggings or cute all-in-ones, Shein are selling <span id=fff18cf7-5b53-46c4-b3c1-72185ee3c4dc class=suggested-link>mini</span> skirts and bodycon dresses online in the children’s section, labelled for ‘toddler’s.</p><p>One woman took to social media, posting under the username @<a href=#>cathyrn_3</a>, to share her shock at the young children’s range.</p><p>Cathryn shared a variety of screenshots of the Shein toddler clothes, as she explained: “I was just looking through Shein toddler dresses and I can’t believe these are even an option.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Fabulous</h2></p><p>“One <span id=f1150197-86f3-4fdc-aee2-b3135013d9ce class=suggested-link>review</span> was ‘sexy and cute’.”</p><p>Showing a picture from Shein’s website, of a child wearing a <a href=#>ribbed fitted dress</a> for £3.49, Cathryn continued: “That’s a literal child.”&nbsp;</p><p>The woman was left disgusted at the clothing and added: “Disbelief parents are actually buying this for their kids.”</p><p>Amongst the screenshots of the tight-fitted clothing, all of which are available to buy online under the ‘young girls dresses’ tab, included a skin tight girls’ <a href=#>asymmetrical neck ruffle trim dress</a> for £4.99.</p><p>Not only this, but Shein is also selling a <a href=#>cut-out ruched dress</a>, which is just £3.99.</p><p>If that wasn’t enough, there’s also a ‘<a href=#>fuzzy trim bow front halter dress</a>’, for £5.49, which is strikingly similar to the raunchy <span id=8c7b4727-1dfe-44f9-bfc5-881aeb93b5d4 class=suggested-link>Christmas</span> outfit worn in Mean Girls during the Jingle Bell Rock scene.</p><p>In disbelief at the outfits, Cathryn later claimed: “Those outfits are for grown women.”</p><p>The fashion retailer was founded in late 2008, by entrepreneur and marketing specialist Xu Yangtian, also known as Chris Xu.</p><p>Very little is known about <a href=#>Shein's </a>mysterious billionaire founder, but he is among China's richest men now the retailer is so popular among young shoppers.</p><p>While many of us love to buy clothes and shoes for super cheap prices on Shein, there have been swathes of quality complaints in the past, which makes sense when looking at the price tag.</p><p>Shein has fielded a number of complaints over its exploitation of workers as a way to offer unrealistically low prices.</p><p>Workers in China were<a href=#> found to be working 75 hour weeks</a> and only one day off a month to keep Shein's fast-fashion production alive and kicking in 2021.</p><p>Supply staff were also found to be <a href=#>paid just £16.50 for a 17 hour day.</a></p><p>But in 2022, Shein said it forced its suppliers to stop this practice, and has since <a href=#>toured influencers around its factories</a> in an effort to scrub up its ethical image.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Shein has been contacted for comment.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Fabulous will pay for your exclusive stories.
