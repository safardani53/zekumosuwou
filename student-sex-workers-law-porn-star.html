I was well informed so I knew what I was getting myself in for - but I was still apprehensive about how it would go, if I’d enjoy it or if I’d hate it and never want to do it ever again.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/NINTCHDBPICT000497369993.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/NINTCHDBPICT000497369974.jpg><p>“But I threw myself into the job and got it done. Once the camera is rolling, it’s almost like you become a different person and you can switch the nerves on and off.”</p><p>She adds: “I had a whole epiphany in that scene. I loved it. It was the best 20 minutes of my life. I wasn’t expecting it to be that way. I realised this was what I was going to do with my life.”</p><h2>'Law and porn don't mix'</h2><p>Ella’s first video was viewed by four million people and, while this meant the offers and the cash started rolling in, the success had dire consequences at uni.</p><p>“News spreads fast around campus - it’s difficult to keep anything quiet in that situation,” she says.</p><p>“Some of my fellow students were rude, some made comments or had digs at me online.</p><p>“Some just said nothing but you could tell what they were thinking.</p><p>“Some even contacted me asking if I wanted to go for a drink with them and their mates and have threesomes etc - expecting me to say yes because that’s what I do for a job. I was angry that they expect me to do it for free."</p><p>Ella was also horrified when news of her new porn career reached her family before she had a chance to tell them, but to her relief, they proved supportive.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/NINTCHDBPICT000497367601-e1560417432277.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/NINTCHDBPICT000497369964.jpg><p>“Mum said as long as I’m safe and happy that’s all that matters,” she says.</p><p>Because of the reaction of her classmates, Ella stopped going to lectures and the comments continued to come in online, leaving her feeling she "was being crushed."</p><p>Eventually, after a discussion with university officials who told her “law and porn don’t mix”, Ella decided to leave the university and finish her degree through the Open University.</p><p>Three years on Ella is an award-winning porn star who also runs her own “premium lines”, making 10-minute custom videos for clients who pay between £100 and £500 a film.</p><p>“It’s ten minutes work but it’s not easy work,” she says. “It’s hard. You have to concentrate and be there for the person who has ordered the custom. Me reaching orgasm is how all the videos end.”</p><h2>'Porn stars are the cleanest people around'</h2><p>As an adult performer, Ella is tested for sexually transmitted infections on a fortnightly basis and wouldn’t be allowed on set without a health certificate.</p><p>Tonight's programme points out that 53 per cent of sexually active students never get tested.</p><p>“The perception of people in the adult industry is that we’re not clean, we’re riddled with STIs and diseases and it’s not true.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/NINTCHDBPICT000497365693.jpg><p>“I have seen how people live at university and they’re not careful and don’t get tested.</p><p>“I’ve had a clean bill of health for four years since I’ve been in this industry and I know that I am completely safe.</p><p>“We are the cleanest people you’ve ever come across.”</p><p>Ella admits there is a huge downside to porn work and advises anyone thinking about it to research thoroughly and be prepared for the backlash.</p><p>"It’s not something to take lightly, not just because of the kind of work you’ll be doing," she says.</p><p>"For me the worst part of this industry is the lack of respect I get from the general public, the disregard I receive, the death threats, abuse thrown at me, comments, name calling and making me feel lower than low. "</p><p>Ella, who says she can never go back to law despite passing her degree, now has two gongs from the UK Adult Producers awards and was recently named Paul Raymond’s female performer of the year at a separate award ceremony.</p><p>“Coming from uni where I was bullied and school where I was very harshly bullied, to come in to an industry where I am celebrated is a huge contrast,” she says tearfully.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Fabulous</h2></p><p>“I wouldn’t want to go back to law. I believe I’ve found my path and I’m more than happy that this is the way my life has turned out.”</p><p>Yesterday's episode featured <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jasmine, a model and exotic dancer</a> who turned to webcam work when she was booted of her paramedic degree.</p><p><strong>Student Sex Workers airs tonight at 10pm on Channel 5&nbsp;</strong></p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Fashion student Carly Rae tells Student Sex Workers she turned to porn to fund degree</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jp%2BYm62cpMK0e5hrb2puZmZ8tMDUnZynrF2osrl51qippJ2iqHqtrdZmp6iqnmLAta3RaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bachelors-haley-fergusson-is-engaged-to-hockey-star-oula-palve.html><span>←</span><span>Bachelors Haley Fergusson Is Engaged to Hockey Star Oula Palve</span></a>
