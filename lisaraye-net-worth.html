If that’s their way of collecting a check and they want to be bothered with something that they didn’t want to be bothered with in the beginning — for 18 years or the rest of their life — then have at it, 'cause that’s exactly what they’re doing,” LisaRaye said (per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bossip</a>). "That’s their meal ticket now.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Raquel then asked LisaRaye about Ari Fletcher— <a href=#>girlfriend of rapper Moneybagg Yo</a> and social media influencer — who has been able to put herself in the same lane financially as G-Herbo, with whom she shares a son.</p><p>Lisa shared that she hasn't been keeping up with her.</p><p>"I ain’t even know all of that either," LisaRaye said. "I don’t even keep up because … seriously, I want to speak and be around folks that’s doing something and not just collecting a bag because ‘it’s about the money.’ Because all money ain’t good money and we heard that before. You need to make the money, don’t let the money make you.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>This comes after LisaRaye made some comments about Ari on a Jan. 20, 2022, episode of Queens with Cocktails. LisaRaye shared her sentiments about Ari's controversy with Fenty X Savage, among other topics.</p><p>As you may recall, Ari was allegedly dropped by Rihanna from Savage X Fenty in January 2022 after Ari previously made some off-color <a href=#>comments about domestic violence</a>.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>“Shout out to Rihanna for standing up and being an example of a woman of her word and making sure that her brand is not tarnished with any foolishness!” LisaRaye said on the show. “See that’s the difference between a social media influencer and a real celebrity and star. There’s a difference …Respectable people, respect you."</p><p>LisaRaye continued: "She was out of line, out of place. She was immature. For the women that look up to her, I hope that they hold her accountable for what she says. I hope that she is learning a lesson to at least come back and say, ‘you know what, I apologize.’ But she needs to give us some type of apology or narrative…”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>LisaRaye didn’t say anything wrong, nor did she personally mention Ari’s name.
