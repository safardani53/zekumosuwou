Her father, a General Motors executive, relocated the family to Van Nuys, California during her teen years where Valerie caught the acting bug. After learning about the Tami Lynn School of Artists from a TV producer neighbor, she was well on her way to stardom — landing the iconic role of Barbara Cooper Royer at just 15-years-old. She continued on the Norman Lear produced sitcom, which followed the family of a recently divorced woman, until 1984.</p><p>Valerie went on to star in several feature films, returning to TV alongside Betty White for ‘Hot In Cleveland’ in 2011.</p><p>She married her first husband, the late <a href=#>Eddie Van Halen</a>, in 1981. Valerie gave birth to the couple’s <a href=#>only son Wolfgang</a> on March 16, 1991, who has followed in his father’s steps as a musician. Eddie and Valerie split in 2007 after over 25 years of marriage. Van Halen passed away in Oct. 2020 after a battle with cancer.
