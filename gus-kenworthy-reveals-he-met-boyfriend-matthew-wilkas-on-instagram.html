We work through all of our issues, we talk, we have amazing communication. But it’s also like … It’s up and down. I spend so much of my time on the road and traveling. We’ll go eight weeks without seeing each other. It’s a difficult relationship, but we work on it.”</p><p class=p1>Although Kenworthy has a house in Denver, Colorado, he tries to spend the majority of his time off with Wilkas, 39, in NYC. “I’m kind of back-and-forth between the two, but more in New York at the moment,” he explained. “Probably after these Olympics, I’ll figure it out and be there more, maybe get rid of my place in Colorado.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/gus-kenworthy.jpg><p class=p1>The silver medalist and the playwright stay in constant communication, even when they can’t physically be with one another. “[We] FaceTime a lot, text, I send him photos of things I see throughout the day, funny things,” Kenworthy said. “When I was just doing the show that I was doing in Peru, we were completely out of contact for a month, so it was quite difficult. Coming back, we had so much to catch up on. But in a way, it was almost nice.”</p><p class=p1>Kenworthy started dating Wilkas in November 2015, one month after he <a href=#>came out</a> in an interview with<a href=#> <i>ESPN</i></a>.</p><p class=p1>“Since I came out of the closet, I’ve gotten to just really be myself and feel authentic and honest and genuine,” he<a href=#> recently disclosed</a> to <i>Us</i>. “It’s just been a huge relief for me competitively.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>With Reporting by Carly Sloane</p><p class=p3><span class=s1>To learn more about Kenworthy, visit teamusa.org.
