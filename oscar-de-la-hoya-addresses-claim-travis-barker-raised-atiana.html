Moakler and Barker went on to have two children together: Landon, 18, and Alabama, 15.</p><p>Earlier this year, the Famous Stars and Straps founder attended the release party for Atiana’s first magazine cover story along with his fiancée, <a href=#><strong>Kourtney Kardashian</strong></a>. Atiana has also expressed her support for her stepdad’s relationship with the <a href=#>Keeping Up With the Kardashians</a> alum, 42, and has joined the duo for family vacations.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Oscar-De-La-Hoya-Addresses-Claim-Travis-Barker-Raised-Atiana-3.jpg><p>“HOTHOTHOT,” <a href=#>Atiana wrote via Instagram in September</a> after the Poosh founder <a href=#>debuted her Skims photo shoot</a> with <a href=#><strong>Megan Fox</strong></a>.</p><p>Atiana’s mother has <a href=#>previously voiced her skepticism about her ex’s relationship</a> with Kardashian, but Oscar has remained supportive of Barker throughout the drama. In May, after Moakler claimed her two younger children were not speaking to her, the Grammy nominee shared a photo himself with the caption, “Leave me alone.”</p><p>In response, Oscar commented, “Damn bro your [sic] cute hahah love you bro,” to which Barker replied, “Haha love you too brother.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Oscar-De-La-Hoya-Addresses-Claim-Travis-Barker-Raised-Atiana-4.jpg><p>The athlete and Moakler were never married, but they had an acrimonious split. After getting engaged in October 1998, the duo called it quits two years later when the former Miss USA winner saw her fiancé taking another woman to the Latin Grammys. Moakler later claimed in a lawsuit that Oscar was an abusive alcoholic. The former couple settled the case out of court in 2001.</p><p>Three years later, Barker and Moakler tied the knot in a California ceremony with a Nightmare Before Christmas theme. The Box Car Racer drummer filed for divorce in August 2006, but the twosome later reconciled. The pair split for good in 2008. <a href=#>Barker proposed to Kardashian</a> in October.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaoq5OWv26wxGajmmWYpMaiecCdm6udo6iytHnCpZiipV2pv6LCyKxkm5mioLKzedGaoKydlGKutbXAp5ho</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./khloe-kardashian-celebrates-magical-36th-birthday-pics.html><span>←</span><span>Khloe Kardashian Celebrates 'Magical' 36th Birthday: Pics</span></a>
