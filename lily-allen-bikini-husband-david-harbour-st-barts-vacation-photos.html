All told it was a difficult and exciting ride, changing diet and exercise plans (or lack thereof).”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>The talented star also attached <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>before and after photos</a> of his weight loss and further explained that the before was taken when his journey began and the second was on the first day of filming season four. “All told I lost over 75lbs. 265-270 in season 3 and all the way down to 190 when we shot,” he shared. He also admitted he recently “ballooned up again” to play St. Nick in a movie, which was most likely this year’s Violent Night from Universal Pictures, and is currently working to get back on track for Stranger Things‘ season five.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/lily-allen-bikini-spl-embed.jpg alt="Lily Allen, David Harbour" width=620 height=932 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Lily and David during a past outing.
