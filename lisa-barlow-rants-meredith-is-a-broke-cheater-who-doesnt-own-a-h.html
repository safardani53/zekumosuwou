Mary accused Lisa Barlow of being "fake" and not really caring about her family (what?).</p><p>Why? Because Lisa … eats Taco Bell.</p><p>Eating Taco Bell just means that you enjoy eating delicious food, but Mary is unhinged and hostile and <a href=#>an alleged cult leader</a> so we don’t know what we expected from her.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/the-hollywood-gossip-res.cloudinary.com/iu/cs_srgb><p>Mary’s unrepentant vileness was challenged by some of her castmates.</p><p>Whitney Rose continued to implore her, in a very Whitney sort of way, to understand why this was so shocking to her.</p><p>This was not the behavior that Whitney expected from a woman who has her own church, but Mary saw no contradiction.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/the-hollywood-gossip-res.cloudinary.com/iu/cs_srgb><p>There was more, of course, including Whitney’s exchange with Meredith — which did not go well for Whitney.</p><p>First, however, Lisa felt extremely disrespected by how Meredith continued to refuse to call out Mary’s bad behavior and to defend her.</p><p>In Lisa’s mind, this had reached a breaking point, and without explanation, she got up from the table and stormed off.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/the-hollywood-gossip-res.cloudinary.com/iu/cs_srgb><p>People get up and leave in a huff on reality TV all of the time, often thinking very little of it.</p><p>That same night, Mary had gotten up to retrieve a jacket because she felt cold at dinner, refusing to bring a blanket for Whitney when asked.</p><p>But while Lisa left in relative silence, her rage was reaching a boiling point.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/the-hollywood-gossip-res.cloudinary.com/iu/cs_srgb><p>There was clearly more going on than Meredith being a better friend to Mary than to Lisa.</p><p>But viewers couldn’t guess what it was, because Lisa did not explain it.</p><p>Instead, she stormed into a room, muttering to herself … which turned into ranting and screaming.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/the-hollywood-gossip-res.cloudinary.com/iu/cs_srgb><p>Thankfully, Lisa was still equipped with her mic, which caught every last word of her tirade.</p><p>"Meredith can go f–k herself, I’m done with her," she declared.</p><p>Lisa continued: "’Cause I’m not a f–king whore and I don’t cheat on my husband."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/the-hollywood-gossip-res.cloudinary.com/iu/cs_srgb><p>"Her and her dumb f–king family that poses," Lisa spat.</p><p>"Why don’t you own a house? Wait, you can’t," she ranted.</p><p>Lisa accused: "’Cause your husband changes jobs every five minutes?"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/the-hollywood-gossip-res.cloudinary.com/iu/cs_srgb><p>"Fake Meredith is a piece of s–t," Lisa griped.</p><p>"’I have your back,’ I’m offended by that. F–k you!" she yelled behind the door.</p><p>Lisa went on: "That f–king piece of s–t garbage whore. I f–king hate her!"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/the-hollywood-gossip-res.cloudinary.com/iu/cs_srgb><p>"She’s a whore. She’s f–ked half of New York!" Lisa claimed. "She can go f–k herself."</p><p>Perhaps the most outlandish moment of all came next, when Lisa opened the door, only half-dressed.</p><p>She threw the microphone at a producer, announcing: "Here, you can have your mic back!"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/the-hollywood-gossip-res.cloudinary.com/iu/cs_srgb><p>That was the jarring end to the episode, and of course it was filmed many months ago.</p><p>Specifically, it was filmed in May of last year, which means that Lisa has had a long time to think about what was going to air.</p><p>Perhaps that is why she apologized to Meredith, who revealed it on Watch What Happens Live.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/the-hollywood-gossip-res.cloudinary.com/iu/cs_srgb><p>"I’m trying to still decipher that," Meredith admitted to Andy as she struggled to explain Lisa’s outburst.</p><p>"When Lisa apologized to me later on, she told me that somebody told her that I said her house was ugly," she described.</p><p>"And," Meredith continued, "that’s why she felt that that tirade was justified. I don’t really understand that, that seems quite vapid to me."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/the-hollywood-gossip-res.cloudinary.com/iu/cs_srgb><p>Meredith admitted that there were "certain clues" that Lisa harbored these kinds of resentments.</p><p>"But this level of hate is far beyond anything I could have ever imagined," she admitted.</p><p>Meredith continued: "The lies that she’s spewing, it’s just incomprehensible."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/the-hollywood-gossip-res.cloudinary.com/iu/cs_srgb><p>So, has Meredith wracked up an impressive body count characterized as "half of New York?" No.</p><p>"Maybe it’s projecting," Meredith shaded. "Seth and I have been very honest, we’ve had moments where we dated other people."</p><p>"We have not dated a lot of other people," she clarified. "I’ve could not even have 10 boyfriends because I’ve never slept with 10 people in my life."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/the-hollywood-gossip-res.cloudinary.com/iu/cs_srgb><p>As for Seth’s work, she noted that the nature of Seth’s work means that he often switches jobs.</p><p>"He’s never been fired from any job he’s ever been at," Meredith affirmed.</p><p>She also noted that, as millions of Americans are painfully aware but powerless to act upon, renting is more expensive than buying.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/the-hollywood-gossip-res.cloudinary.com/iu/cs_srgb><p>Meredith explained that she and Seth are renting because they’re not sure what house they want to get.</p><p>Right now, they have an "empty nest" for the first time, so they don’t want to rush into a house that isn’t right for them.</p><p>"I don’t discuss anyone else’s money," Meredith added. "I was raised that that’s in very poor taste and I find it kind of repulsive that she’s going there with me."</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY6voJ2dn6h8rbXSmmSbmaKhvLh50ZqlratdorKzscOiq6Flmah6onnBq6aknV2Ytaat056pZq%2BYpHqlu8Sspa1ln6y7bq2MoWY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./hiv-aids-advocate-jake-glaser-on-overcoming-survivors-guilt-his-next-chapter.html><span>←</span><span>HIV Survivor Jake Glaser on Continuing Mom Elizabeth's AIDS Advocacy</span></a>
