There was a real healing thing that happened.</p><p>“Between the three of us - me, Timbaland and JT - we’ve all had long careers with ups and downs and to me personally, doing this song together feels very authentic and is a mini-miracle.”</p><p>After that, super producer Timbaland offered up the track which will be their new single.</p><p>Speaking on the High Low With EmRata podcast, she said: “It started with Tim and JT.</p><p>“Tim texted me like, ‘Yo, I’ve got a track for you, it’s a dance vibe, for a trio,’ and I was like, ‘You mean with JT?’ And he was like, ‘Yes’.</p><p>“Him and JT have been working on music for like a year already, separately from me, so they just had an idea and they wanted me to woman the ship a little in my direction so they could feed off that.</p><p>“We just cooked it up.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Bizarre</h2></p><p>“I think energetically it’s very positive. For me, the lyrics and everything are very real to me right now.”</p><p>Speaking earlier this year, Nelly – who is behind hits including Promiscuous and Maneater – said it was her daughter who made her realise the impact her music had on the industry.</p><p>She told Fault Magazine in May: “When it comes to my legacy, it has only started to connect in the last few years because of TikTok.</p><p>“One day, my daughter said, ‘Mum, your music is trending on TikTok.’</p><p>“I didn’t even have TikTok on my phone, and I didn’t know how to use it.</p><p>“We started making fun little videos on there.</p><p>“At the same time, I started going out and often hearing my music being played.</p><p>“I found out why the DJs were playing these old songs and discovered that people want to celebrate and have fun to my music.</p><p>“When I started in this business, people would say, “Oh, maybe I’m a one-hit wonder,” but 20 years have gone by and people still like my music.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hwaGmEcYKWaKWepJyueqfB0a2Ynaddn8K0wMinZK2hnZeys7jApJxmrJmir6K4wKebZqqVqruqwMinnmamlax6tLXNoKOeZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./icarly-season-3-carly-freddie-romance-interview.html><span>←</span><span>Nathan Kress On Carly &amp;amp; Freddie Romance (Exclusive) Hollywood Life</span></a>
