The actress certainly does not hold back, which makes her all the more relatable to fans going through similar situations.</p><p>“I gauge what is appropriate and what is necessary, and I always laugh when people say things like, ‘You <a href=#>reveal everything on social media</a>!’ because I think to myself, ‘Oh, well, if only you knew!’” the&nbsp;Cougar Town&nbsp;alum exclusively told&nbsp;Us Weekly&nbsp;in July 2019. “I think that part of the value in what we all can do, whether we’re in the entertainment industry or not, is share our stories and be open to hearing other people’s. I think that that is truly how and what we need to do right now, in this country especially. Truly, I think it’s incredible.”</p><p>She added: “The internet has been such a <a href=# data-gift=1>gift</a> to connect us to people all over the world who are having similar experiences or who have gone through similar things or who are parenting and trying to do their best.”</p><p>Amid her willingness to share intimate details of her day-to-day life, Philipps proves she is no different than any other person trying to make their way through the world. “You just have to focus on what’s really important in life, and that’s <a href=#>your friends</a> and your family and the life that you build,” she revealed to&nbsp;Us&nbsp;in April 2017.</p><p>The&nbsp;<a href=#>Dawson’s Creek</a>&nbsp;alum’s honesty is apparent in her musings on those things that mean the most to her. She married husband <strong>Marc Silverstein</strong> in June 2007 and went on to welcome Birdie in August 2008 and Cricket in July 2013.</p><p>After 14 years of marriage, Philipps announced in May 2022 that she and the screenwriter had separated in February 2021. She candidly discussed <a href=#>their breakup</a> on her “Busy Philipps Is Doing Her Best” podcast and revealed why she chose to go public with the news over a year later.</p><p>“The surest way that Marc and I have been able to ensure the privacy of our kids that we love so f—ing much was by not involving the public,” she explained in part.</p><p>Over the years, the Girl5eva star has also chosen to go public with important information about her children, like when&nbsp;she revealed in December 2020 that <a href=#>Birdie is gay and uses they/them pronouns</a>. “For those of you who are my friends listening at home, this is the first you’re hearing that Birdie is gay and out,” she explained on her “Busy Philipps Is Doing Her Best” podcast. “Birdie told us at 10 years old and we immediately … I mean, obviously, I knew that Birdie knew.” Six months later, Philipps noted that Birdie is nonbinary.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>When she is not balancing family and her friendship with former&nbsp;Dawson’s Creek&nbsp;costar <a href=#><strong>Michelle Williams</strong></a>, Philipps is dominating everything from acting to writing to hosting. In fact, her 2018 memoir,&nbsp;This Will Only Hurt a Little, served as another avenue for her to <a href=#>share stories from her past</a> filled with vulnerability and openness.</p><p>Scroll down to revisit Philipps’ most honest quotes about motherhood, marriage, work and more.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkr7a%2F2GanoaGcnr2xv4ympqysXZ28r7HSrWSmp6SdsrO0zqibZqWRp7%2BqrcaeZKqtn6mytHnPoaatp6Nk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./austin-mcbroom.html><span>←</span><span>Austin Mcbroom- Wiki, Age, Height, Net Worth, Wife, Ethnicity</span></a>
